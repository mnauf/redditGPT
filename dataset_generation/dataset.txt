Thoughts on the arrest of former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan?

The guys who arrested Imran Khan hit him over the head with a baton and broke his wheelchair (He'd been using it because he was shot twice in the leg in an assassination attempt).

This is pathetic brutality and is just another tactic to quash dissent because the illegally-imposed government know that they've long lost the people's trust and confidence. Their next move will be to prevent elections from occurring because they know that if elections are held, they'll be defeated to oblivion.

The Pakistani people need to rise up and overthrow the oppressors. This is a "make-or-break" point for us.

Wow, according to the Pakistani users here, he is really popular. There will be some big protests coming on the following days ...

In this vein, what makes him so popular? is he anti military or pro military? Or is that not an issue in Pakistan?

The based Pakistani PM 😔😔😔 

May Allah curse the Pakistani and Egyptian military leaders. They are destroying our countries.

Bad

[Imran Khan: Ex-PM arrested outside court in Pakistan](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65531648)

why tf would they arrest Sultan Imran? I heard he's been in hot water for some time, but damn...

Among all leaders Pakistan has had, Imran is the best. He is a natural born leader and tells the truth most of the time. Had he come to national leadership, say 3 decades ago, he would have turned Pakistan into a very progressive and well developed nation. He has an inspiring charisma in him. Unfortunately he came to power too late. By this time, the corrupt politicians and their military had completely messed up the country to the point where even his leadership was not able to turn the ride around. It was too late. 

Without a good economy to support, Pakistan is staring at the brink. If they hurt him or finish him off due to any shortsighted move, Pakistan will enter into a civil war. I hope sanity prevails.

One of the few guys who actually had guts to stand up against the corrupt and now the whole nation cries inside their home waiting for a unicorn to save them from corrupt politicians and Army.

Everybody knows the army runs the show but they can't stand up to the same army nor will they do anything against the corrupt politicians the only time Pakistanis get excited is for cricket or against their enemies never for them.
Another example of a failed nation that had huge potential but got ruined due to criminals masquerading corruption under religious Identity.

PAKISTAN need to be lead by the king of king, king of israel, king of Um Al Dunya, and UAE, the honorable zionist Mop, Al fatah Sissi.

bad for pakistani people and it's a completely wack economy. only people on the internet loving this, are indians, don't know why they are so obsessed with us

This is the same military coup/military dominance garbage that has occurred across the Muslim world for the last 80 years, largely with Western support.

Since 1960, Turkey has had 4 military coups and 1 additional military coup attempt:

1. 1960, in which democratically elected Prime Minister Adnan Menderes was arrested and executed by hanging by the military.
2. 1973
3. 1982
4. 1997 - Coup by Memorandum.
5. 2016 - Attempted coup to overthrow democratically elected President Erdogan, backed by FETO leader Fetullah Gulen.

Egypt: Military coup in 2013 that overthrew the first and only democratically elected president of the country, Mohammed Morsi. (I'm not counting the 98% results of the last two elections electing coup leader Abdel Fatah el-Sisi). The military domination and corruption of the nation's government and economy is famously known. U.S. President Donald Trump publically referred to Sisi as "my favorite dictator." Of course President Morsi was left to rot and eventually die in prison like an animal. And by amazing "coincidence," Morsi's 25-year-old healthy son Abdullah Morsi just happened to die of a "heart attack" within a year. Of course there were subsequent reports of probable poisoning. Gee, I wonder how that could have happened. 

Indonesia: In 1965, military general Suharto overthrew democratically elected leader Sukarno and ruled the country for more than 30 years. 

Pakistan's military coup in also famous. 

As usual, the U.S. White House has basically nothing to say about PM Khan's arrest today. God forbid a democratically elected leader might actually try to solve some of the corruption of his country. 

I pray that the Pakistani people don't tolerate this outrageous miscarriage of justice and the Pakistani military will release PM Khan.

Wait, he got arrested AGAIN??

Thats a shame. I like him a lot, and many RW Indians also liked him.

western governments took him out.

Official U.S. response by Secretary of State Anthony Blinken to the arrest of PM Khan by Pakistani military:

  
[https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5069859/secretary-blinken-reacts-arrest-prime-minister-imran-khan-pakistan](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5069859/secretary-blinken-reacts-arrest-prime-minister-imran-khan-pakistan)  


It's a 25-second video. He says: "With regard to Pakistan, of course I've seen the reports that you alluded to. We just want to make sure that whatever happens in Pakistan is consistent with the rule of law with the constitution." Translation: "Nice job, military."

FREE THE LEGITIMATE LEADER OF PAKISTAN

another country bites the dust

Mindless fools. He was also working for a better for life for those policemen, their friends and families. They should arrest the other side.

Marshallaw, agent Imran is proving to be the best Endian RAA agent.

When Imran Khan was in power, he used the same national accountability bureau to arrest opponents. He wouldn't let the court hearing being set so those he arrested would stay in custody. The chairman of national accountability bureau was an ex judge and favored Imran Khan totally. At that time the supporters of Imran Khan used to say law enforcement and military don't arrest anyone for no reason since that time military was in support of Imran Khan. Today it's just karma catching up and Imran Khan being on receiving end. It's still not the level of brutality he did during his own tenure as prime minister.

Can't say I feel bad

Imran Khan is probably the most evil man in the history of Pakistan he should pay for what he has done to this nation

another country bites the dust

such a backward country

West is promoting Imran Khan as the future dictator of Pakistan. He is following the same footsteps of Erdogan. Erdogan was jailed for 6 months too.

It was overdue.Indians and Israelis haven’t been this successful in spreading divide and hate amongst the Nation as much as Taliban Khan has.He should be charged for treason.And what his supporters are doing to military infrastructure,PTI should be outlawed.

Pakistan is a failed state. Tell me something new

Very good, he colluded with Army and arrested Nawaz, Zardari and other apposition leaders and putted them in death cells, he should also face the music now. No sympathy for him or his followers till they apologise to apposition.

He is just a piece of shit

USA

Thoughts on Imran Khan?

He looks like a Texan cowboy

Walter White

BASED!!

Handsome as fuck

Cool guy I guess

Based leader. Sadly. Cia had to dispose him.

the guy must must have been a lady magnet in his days

Removed by the Washington cabal. Great leader for Pakistan.

The most competent leader we could have. By no means perfect, but it was what we needed at the time. 

Pakistan can’t have good things though.

The only hope for Pakistan. The other morons running the country are just thieves.

based af

The most based Khan

This sub is teaching me about people I’ve never heard about before

The first person that pops into my head when I read the word BASED

Kinda looks like gaddafi

As a Bangladeshi I respect him, but he's too idealistic. His idealism although admirable caused him to lose power.

The best Pakistani leader in recent memory. He obviously by no means was perfect, had some pretty bad takes during his speeches, but relative to our current leadership and leaders of the past, he was much, much better.

He handled all foreign leaders like a champ, and won the respect of all. But unfortunately we can't have nice things, while he still have a large majority of population supporting him, it is quite frustrating the way corrupt politicians, military personnel and certain mullahs banded for his forceful removal.

W leader 🫡

i will keep it short...would die for him, would kill for him

Immi chan 🥵


Among the GOAT cricketers and the best option for Pakistan of the current choices.

Emir Al Mumineen

Based leader

was making steps in the right direction, def was not perfect. had some iffy takes. but shii, no one would be better than him as of rn

I don't know about his political actions but he's one of the most handsome leaders. By the way he looks like either Turkmen or European

Our prime minister

Holy cow he’s handsome

My name is Waltah Khanwell Safed. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Islamabad, Pakistan, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki "Yagoo" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a "hit" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.

Honestly he’s all talk, he hasn’t done anything to improve the countries well-being in the last 3 years. People just like him because he won the cricket World Cup for the country lol … He’s as useless &amp; corrupt as the previous leaders, just better at convincing the illiterate Pakistanis that he is not.

Hope for Pakistan. Too depend and pleasing towards China which may give short term benefits but using it’s usual debt-trap tact to strangle Pakistan. This is sad. Someone above rightly said, Imran Khan is not the best, but its the best option Pak has right now.

Our rightful caliph 🥺

We should fucking sue Pakistan for copyright claim on that flag. Either that or we need to change our own flag.

He loves Pakistan and he will sacrifice his life for Pakistan.

I have no idea what he did to become so popular among the Reddit Pakistanis.

Not the military, so he is a step forward in Pakistan for Democracy. I don't know how effective his policies were.

I personally don’t like him but a lot of Pakistanis do and that’s what matters. He should honestly still be PM right now.

the best khan

Not at all a statesman but beautiful of course 😁

Puppet of China. He defended genocide of Muslims in China for money.

It's insane so-called Muslims like him. Would they still like him if he was a Zionist and defended Israel's treatment of Muslims in Palestine?

He appeared to be an incredibly incompetent politician from an outsiders perspective. 

A lot of my Pakistani friends liked him a lot in the sense that he was the "least corrupt." However he didn't appear to be very effective, and it seemed the people he brought into his government were quite corrupt anyways, making his time pretty comparable to past regimes in terms of corruption. 

He also said a lot of dumb shit which did not help him in the international arena at all. 

Not sure I'd give the guy a C- or a D, but I guess when you've been dealing with F grade for the entire existence of your country, someone that could be a C is a messiah lol.

His followers will soon declare him latter day prophet....

Pakistani trump. The followers prove it.

A lot of morons ITT

populist

Zindabad

Based Turkish leader

Another populist in a world dime a dozen filled with populists.

Idealist me thought he and Modi would have made SAARC better in the past but it is now even more of a joke.

That said, almost every Pakistani I met online holds him in high regard and he is their choice after all. So gotta respect that. And he does seem to be better option than other corrupt politicians there.

I dunno how much of this is true or is usual Indian media BS but Imran Khan once apparently said Nepal is in Kathmandu. Funny story.

He dyes his hair

Cricket player

Good guy but he doesn't have good people around him.

Al Qaida and Bin Laden sympathizer

Highly based.  But Pakistan is a corrupt failed state &amp; the CIA didn’t like him.

Considers Osma Bin Laden as a martyr and vulgarity as reason of rape. True representative of radical Islamic  Republic of Pakistan. Did nothing to help absolute brutality against Pakistan's minorities while fueling jihadists. And we can now see everyday blasts in Pakistan.

 "You can't keep snakes in your backyard and hope they will only bite your neighbors".

Footage of the room from which Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was abducted by paramilitary forces. Thoughts ?



He’s like “ not this shit again”

AND HE SITS THERE UNFAZED!!!!!

Nice room

Bros tired and has enough of everyone's bs

Bro is just daydreaming 💀

The way he couldn’t care less cracks me up 💀 He has balls for sure!

The guys outside in riot gear are the paramilitary and are yelling at Imran Khan's people to open the door.

Imran Khan is the guy in the sunglasses.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has declared the arrest illegal and Imran Khan was finally able to return home after 4 days in custody.

Unfortunately, 50 protestors were killed by the government and hundreds are still incarcerated on trumped up charges.

I have to say even as an Indian I have respect for Imran Khan, the guy has balls.

This guy's is working overtime to get rid of the corruption and give power back to the people. 

Unfortunately the military and the cronies in power aren't going to give it up democratically

He's back home btw

His reaction was like “Oh my Allah I’m tired of this shit”

The new Pakistani government is a US lap dog, no wonder why they want to silence Imran Khan.

Where's his cricket bat when he needs it lol.

Imran Khan is handsome AF

I don’t know about Pakistans internal politics however in Turkey getting arrested is the best thing that can happen for a political leader. As soon as they are released they are guaranteed to win the next election.

He has sunglasses on and is probably thinking of what’s his streak for having attacks made on him.

My thoughts it's a very small room crowded with to many people.

None of these political videos ever play for me but any other video will it's  frustrating

Can someone explain the context?

He should have been in custody for a while longer people where starting to go crazy on the army and could have had some revolutionary movement even without the power of political leaders but after he got released it's all gone down the drain slowly things will be the same as it used to be before.

This guy has most of the judges in his back pocket. It was hilarious how chief justice of pakistan was acting like a pet dog of Imran when he entered the court room.

What this gotta do with the Middle East

Pakistan is not Middle Eastern

The man was catapulted into power by the army via Project Imran, which was conceived in 2011 and executed to near-perfection in 2017. Did he really think they won’t come after him one day? He live by the army, you die by the army.

First thought? Why is this on r/askmiddleeast? Can't you guys make r/desimuslims or something like that?! Truly don't care about this-- love Turkey

Lol Imran stole 60 billion from Pakistan he wasn't abducted he was arrested and he got bail with a few hours, his thugs started riots and looting.. he is probably the biggest thief in the history of Pakistan and we have many thieves in our history.

If I was a time traveler and told you a MENA country will have a better economy, better quality of life than Western Europe by 2050 which country do you think I’m talking about?



[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/13gyeiu)

I don't think it's Egypt for one reason: their military. Kinda like us.

Unless Egypt finally utilizes its large population and begins producing things for the world like China did, then that’s how we will grow

Gulf countries

Egypt and Tunisia are fucked imo 

Not Morocco 

Probably Iraq or Algeria if they got their shit together quickly

If oil still relevant in 2050, then Iraq most likely.

It really depends, but i guess for the petrostates in the region algeria has the best chance 

1.algeria is stable with decent infrastructure compared to libya,iraq,syria... we are also pretty in a position that allows to control some of sub sahara africa since there's talks about a railway from Algiers to lagos which means huge trade with nigeria which is the biggest economy in Africa 

2.algeria is more of gas state than petro state and gas and the day humanity stop using gas is still very far 

3.algeria already has big working population that u can put in multiple industries, unlike the gulf countries which have a small population with a sizable population of non working women


Also algeria has big arable land,while the gulf is heavily dependent on imports and we have good amount of rare earth metals which allows us control our supply chain 

All that means if Algeria falls in the hands of a competent leader it won't take long to develop 

Finally, Morocco is also doing good but it needs more of indigenous companies and research and development or it will be fucked

None on this list

NONE OF THEM.

Absolutely impossible.

But from these 5, Morocco is most likely to be slightly better off than the others, if the current trend continues.

Morocco and Egypt if they invested in clean solar energy and began powering Europe that is already moving away from oil then they can surpass the gulf easy plus gain a lot of influence over Europe. 

Also in Egypts case if it concentrates in the services, production, media and Tourism sectors the population will simply reach another level. 

The potential is there. It’s just untapped and I think Egypt and Morocco have the highest potential

I would say MBS and MBZ is doing great things to it’s own citizens something we barely see in the Arabian countries anymore 🤷‍♂️

I love how everyone hating MBS and MBZ aren’t citizens of Saudi or the UAE.

Surely the people of UAE and Saudi are the best judges of their leaders, and our opinion of them is clearly positive.

Where is Kais Sayed?

A good Arabian leader is a myth IMHO.

![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)

- None of the above.

MBZ seems to have the most successful country out of these leaders

Morocco and Saudi Arabia

I'm Moroccon i went with mbs . The guy is lagend

Had to be a Gulf leader, either Saudi or Emirates.

Emir Al Tawheed Habibi MBS

You forgot the best president Qais Saiyed, he exposed the Western ploy of changing the demographic in North Africa.

You think it's funny but that already started with the media attacks and blackwashing of North African/Egyptian history.

Being attacked by the West at this point is a badge of honor.

Can anyone name yemens president without googling it?

I think questions like this are nonsense; Arab world problems isn’t mainly in the leaders or if they are elected or not , many countries succeeded while they dictatorships or under military junta, China for example Imperial Germany was successful, prewar Japan, Russia to some extent, Franco Spain, Greece under military junta, South Korea under military junta, Vietnam and Singapore; so the idea that the problem is we need democracy is too simplistic and don’t identify the issue; 
(I don’t say that dictatorships are good or bad) just that I think if we became democracy it would not improve anything, we would become like many democracies that are failed in human development, I think we have bigger problems that should be studied outside of political bias.

I was expecting MBZ to have more votes, ngl kinda shocked.

Tamim amir of Qatar is pretty good

Why MBS? He's just a dictator like everybody else

King abdullah of jordan

Why isn't Amr Diab an option :( 😔

Seeing the poll options laid out like this…truly a dismal state of affairs for the Arab world

Imran Khan

1- Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani: least corrupt ,cares about building the country ,respect its people and provide them welfare. 

2-rest of gulf monarchs: like Qatar but more corruption(ex Kuwait) ,lazy/slow management(ex uae,Saudi) ,funding arab dictators(ex Oman,Kuwait)

3- those shitty dictators. Can’t manage economy and social problems. Cares little about their own and commit genocide on their own ,can’t defend their countries ,sold themselves for foreign powers who think little about them.

This poll sucks.

King Abdullah II of Jordan. Because he’s based and a total badass

Who’s picking MBS? Dudes Mr Chop Chop….

“Arab” lmfao

I do t know much about Morocco and Algeria, but: 
Sisi is a$$ kicker 
MBS is still in need for a lot of experience 
MBZ is not considered arab though

These Arabs wants freedom and to be on the top, yet they are the first to kiss the shoes of their leaders, as if it's a competition, so others people sees how we love our leaders. Sheeps

I see people down voting, let me edit:

*I meant in particular the Saudis and Morocco, not all Arabs

Sisi😹

As an Emirati Sheikh Tamim and MBZ are definitely the best in terms of development.

The Sultan of Oman Qabus

None. All only care about self interest and the sustainability of their regimes and families. But the one who had the most positive impact on his country in the past couple of years is MBS.

His kids would become PM of UK in 20 years and he will still be on YouTube calling for ‘elections’. The military will never let him win.

It's great, that he does not come from a political dynasty family or from the military, because Pakistan has a big problem with these types of politicians. 

Imran Khan is a political outsider and because of that slightly less corrupt than his opposition. His love for the Taliban and involvement in state-sponsored terrorism are cringe tho.

Yes because he won Pakistan a World Cup and was numba one handsome prime minister 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Yesterday I ate Indian food at a restaurant whose owner cooked for Modi and Netanyahu. She's an Indian Jew.

I also met Indian students at my university today, and I don't think they like Pakistan. I asked them if the Kashmir Files is worth watching and they said yes. Some of them have PhDs, so they're probably right.

What are your thoughts on the Kashmir issue between India, China and Pakistan?



kashmir belongs to iraq 😤😤😤😤☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽💪🏽☝🏽💪🏽☝🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶

China just took that slice of Kashmir to secure their border on that side so I wouldn't put china in the whole issue but it's very complex


Imo and no hate to my Pakistani brozzers but from the start  it looked like Kashmir wanted to be it's own country not be apart of any of the three

People don't realise the whole area which is called isn't actually Kashmir and majority of it is literally Ladakh. So if they had an option,Kashmiris as in from the valley and surrounding areas would either choose Independence or Pakistan, Jammu at large would choose India and Ladakh which has a Buddhist majority as well will choose India.




As for how a referendum, Pakistanis cry like the babies they are but forget the literal first thing the UN resolution for it said the Pakistani military will have to leave it's occupied areas followed by an Indian demilitarization.

If you want to look at Indian Hypocrisy in relation to Kashmir you can just look at the case of the princely state of [Hyderabad](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Hyderabad_in_India_%281951%29.svg/1200px-Hyderabad_in_India_%281951%29.svg.png) 


Hyderabad in many ways was a direct parallel to Kashmir. Hyderabad was a monarchy with a Muslim ruler. It had a Hindu majority and a Muslim minority. It too was partnered with Britain extensively throughout its existence. And it also decided not to join either Pakistan or India and decided to stay independent.


India couldn’t stand the fact that Hyderabad didn’t join the union. But it decided to sign a standstill agreement with them for a year. But the second Hyderabad started gathering troops and opening channels to countries and organizations in hopes of maintains its independence, including Pakistan, it decided to invade and depose the monarchy to bring it into its territory.


And as with everything in India it didn’t go very [pretty](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24159594.amp) 

&gt; Historians say their desire to prevent an independent Muslim-led state taking root in the heart of predominantly Hindu India was another worry.

&gt; Members of the powerful Razakar militia, the armed wing of Hyderabad's most powerful Muslim political party, were terrorising many Hindu villagers.


&gt; The Nizam's forces were defeated after just a few days without any significant loss of civilian lives. But word then reached Delhi that arson, looting and the mass murder and rape of Muslims had followed the invasion.


&gt; Determined to get to the bottom of what was happening, an alarmed Nehru commissioned a small mixed-faith team to go to Hyderabad to investigate. It was led by a Hindu congressman, Pandit Sunderlal. But the resulting report that bore his name was never published.

&gt; The team reported that while Muslim villagers were disarmed by the Indian Army, Hindus were often left with their weapons. The mob violence that ensued was often led by Hindu paramilitary groups. In other cases, it said, Indian soldiers themselves took an active hand in the butchery: "At a number of places members of the armed forces brought out Muslim adult males from villages and towns and massacred them in cold blood."

&gt; The Sunderlal report estimated that between 27,000 to 40,000 people lost their lives.

Keeping opinions aside , Pakistan is almost broke to handle another few million mouths to feed apart from their own 220+ million people.

On the other hand, India has been doing pretty well and the infrastructure push in the past few years has been the most. Also The geographical area of Kashmir has Hindu majority Jammu which has the largest chunk of population will side with India and has been largely integrated already.

Buddhist chunk Leh and Ladakh has the biggest area and they are also integrated. 

Now comes the valley of Kashmir, some may go with Pakistan if they want to follow the religion but after abrogation of 370 and after Kashmir is being directly ruled by Central government, they are getting more opportunities and investment and are getting integrated into the mainstream ( some.of them may not want to) so I see a financial incentive for them to stay with India. 

Also given all the financial bad news coming from Pakistan these days, it's a bad decision on their part too lol but they should be allowed to if they want. Most of the people outside think Kashmir is just Muslim while it has a huge population of pro India Hindus and Buddhist and now the government is settling people there and will change the demographics in a few years

Idk tbh, they should hold a referendum to decide weather they would want to join pakistan or india or become independant.

It is rightful Moroccan land 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦

Thoughts on Imran Khan?



Very nice shaved face

Obligatory 🥵🥵🥵🔥🔥 on Immy Chad post.

Probably shagged many British girls in the 80's.

Damn! He's so handsome &amp; charisma despite his age *.*

Did he win again or what?

I’ve seen this post three times already this month

He is hypocrite, he believes in witchcraft, he even tried to run his government with witchcraft, his wife practices witchcraft, he brought Pakistan to bring of the bankruptcy, he is the most uncapable man in politics of Pakistan.

He has Bastard child from English women, but now he preach religion to whole Pakistan, He was never there to guid his daughter but now want to lead Pakistani Youth.

Is r/Pakistan leaking into this sub?

He embodies the spirit of scapegoating.

If Imran Khan's wife was pregnant he'd say India was responsible.

Thoughts On The Quaid E Azam Muhummad Ali Jinnah



The only Pakistani leader I would salute o7

A good man with good intentions. He made a big mistake of also making the national language of East pakistan(Bangladesh) Urdu which caused some issues. Unfortunately,he died too soon after the state of Pakistan was formed.

Zindabad!

I think if he had actually lived a little longer to see his vision of Pakistan through then Pakistan would be a VERY different country to the one it is today. Also his choice to make Urdu the lingua franca in my opinion was a mistake.

One of his most famous quote "Indian Muslim that oppose the creation of Pakistan will forever have to prove their loyalty to Hindu until the day they die"

Chad, even though he's not without sins or mistakes, he's a proud muslims, a leader one can be proud of.

Only Pakistani who liked Ataturk

Merry Quaidmas

An absolute legend. 

Stanley Wolpert’s famous quote encapsulates Jinnah’s greatness: ‘Few individuals significantly alter the course of history. Fewer still modify the map of the world. Hardly anyone can be credited with creating a nation-state. Mohammad Ali Jinnah did all three.’

The only country in the world that was formed in the name of Islam. He was an absolute legend. 

Happy birthday to our great Quaid!

Jinnah - A second generation son of a lower caste Hindu man. A Shiite, who regularly used to drink whisky, married a Parsi woman, had a Parsi daughter who went on to marry on a Parsi and never visited the country (Pakistan), her father founded.

I heard he had sugma

Good guy who successfully completed an ill-conceived plan that led to the division of the Muslims of India in 3 equal parts as opposed to a united Hindu majority.

No thoughts on him

And then he gave up Rakhine to Burma. And the whole Pakistani treatment of Bangladeshis were slave-like because they weren't white enough or Punjabi.

Pork eating, whiskey drinking, self claimed atheist ceaselessly rallied, in the name of Islam, to huddle the millions of unproductive population at one corner so that his original country could thrive

Good intentions, incompetent leadership.

He was a gujju lawyer educated in England  as was Gandhi and Patel so they were all not so different than each other as one might want them to be . Just each wanted power so destroyed lives of millions during partition

"He will become babur..."

Baabuur (Bāábùř): def. Automobile

Thoughts on this ‘assassination attempt’ ?



Literally every good leader of a arabic/muslim country in the modern age is either killed or long died🤷‍♂️

was only a matter of time... he's too handsome to be left alive

My man was still [smiling](https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/yl1dtl/imran_khan_getting_in_his_car_after_being_shot/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) after getting shot.


I don’t wanna say it’s deja vu but the pattern keeps repeating. First it was Fatima Jinnah, the sister of founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah, literally called “Mother of the Nation”, who stood up against Ayub, our first ever dictator swimming in American money who loved meeting [JFK](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9CFpYzBq9JE/Vsy-sraCziI/AAAAAAAAHgY/_lrYkPQU6zI/s1600/JFK-Ayub-WhiteHouse.jpg) for some reason. After she received immensely popular support in both Pakistan and Bangladesh(even the founder of Bangladesh forwarded her cause), and winning many seats despite extremely blatant rigging, she wouldn’t win. Two years later she would die under mysterious circumstances. People wouldn’t be allowed near her body and was rumoured she had knife wounds.


Next it was Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto , the self proclaimed socialist who would be hanged (whom I have no sympathy for) but again it would be done by Zia, the Islamist theocrat military dictator, who hated western culture and called it everything wrong with society on one hand and then gladly took their money to train Mujahideen in Afghanistan and meeting with [Reagan](https://im.rediff.com/news/2017/jul/06muhammad5.jpg).

Then it was Benazir, another one I have less sympathy for but she’d too be murdered in a suicide bombing and many claim Musharraf behind the attack, because she was protesting his dictatorship. Musharraf dammed Pakistan by participating in America’s war in Afghanistan and taking their aid. The following terrorism in Pakistan is something we’ll never recover from.


And now it’s Imran Khan. Let’s hope he actually succeeds where other had failed before him and doesn’t have the same fate of a mysterious death

A foolish thing to do when you have someone as popular as he is

I know people will have all sorts of conspiracies on this one. Sad part is this will now cause more chaos and polarization of the Pakistani society and push more people to extremes. Sigh

Sad 😕

Imran Khan is literally the only reason pakistan was doing relatively good. Stupid they made him leave.

Democratic institutions are weak in Pakistan. The military is too powerful.

I feel like Pakistan is a defacto military junta.

That means he’s doing a good job.

CIA or MI6 ?

May Allah keep him alive. He isn't necessarily the best leader, but he is the best that pakistan could get currently. The others are so cripppled and and corrupt that they forgot they have a country to run.

Any Muslim leader who speaks out about Muslim interests and/or refuses to be a puppet for the West gets targeted.  It happened to Morsi, it happened to Erdogan, and now it’s happened to Imran Khan.

Well the CIA was "definitely" not involved in it. 😂😂😂

He will die for Pakistan, and they will sacrifice his life for Pakistan

They tried to kill him because they are scared of the Pak-Turk Empire next year

If he dies, any remaining shred of hope for Pakistan dies too.

Pakistan zendabad

The assassination attempt was that they put extra chilli in his biryani

He’s too popular to be kept alive. Just like Egypt’s morsi the government did everything to get rid of him.

CIA

Just devastating. Hope Pakistan can get through this.

Btw is pakistan considered a part of middle east or is this just a muslim country of the region

My hero

Who is he?

Ridiculous comments. Everytime something bad happens it must be the Americans, or the Jews. 

Imran Khan was brought in by the army, he was taken out by the army. Pakistan is built for the army. 
No matter which leader comes, the military will always have a hand up their ass.

Imran is a hypocrite and a goof, along with his die hard followers. A man of many contradictions. One who has claimed many stupid things in the past.

Of course, most if not all Pakistani desi diaspora support him from outside the country. He receives lots of support within the country as well. But popular support means nothing when you are already the slave of the military and its western masters.

Lol Pakistan is also now in the ‘Middle East’.

It's a miracle every year that passes without pakistans collapse. It only exists because it's propped up by china, usa and the west all of whom would rather not let the fanatic part of the population have acess to the nuclear weapons.

Imran Khan is a terrorist. He called the Taliban scum "liberators" and said that Osama bin Laden was a "shaheed". I don't know if him getting ousted was a CIA plot like the conspiracy theorists say, but if it was, I say "Good work getting an extremist terrorist out of power in a country with a nuclear arsenal, boys".

My massage to the assassins😡😡: be more accurate next time

Seems like propaganda to me. I heard that his part members say he was shot 3-4 times in his leg. Man literally got shot and they do not even know how many bullets got in there. Secondly, the way he was shown walking is not normal for someone who has been shot "3-4 times in the leg". Lastly, if there was to be an assassination on him, it would be much more professional and he would simply not live given how vulnerable of a position he was in when he was shot.

Not good, should've used a bomb instead.

Thoughts on Imran Khan?? a guy claimed to have ruined Pakistan's diplomatic position.

PTI Youthiyas want always looking for international approval for populist Mahatma..

Which of the following Countries should be considered as "The Leader of the Muslim World" ?

Suggest your favorite historic/current country if you choose any of the last 2 options.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/yd3xh4)

Bruh who vote for Turkey?

Sweden

Brunei

Muslim unity is long gone

Kurds ? Arabs and Turks failed its their time to try lmao

Why isn't Indonesia on the list? It's projected to become the 4th biggest economy in the future, it's people are more religious compared to Anatolians, it's a mess but less messy than the options you presented.

KSA is trying to liberalize it's people and has failed sunnis, in Syria it supported Jaysh al Islam as it was surrounded, they were able to take Damascus but didn't do it waiting for orders from their Saudi seniors whom without they'd have no power to do anything, the attack was postponed and then KSA left the ghouta to face destruction and annihilation as the expected Russian intervention occured, I once visited it after what happened, look up eastern ghouta, a land that was freed from any signs of human life, any sincere sunni wouldn't trust KSA ever again may the Saudi rulers burn in jahannam, Iran is hated by any sincere sunni (the current government and no it's not going anytime soon), Egypt wages wars against their Islamists, Turkey is more nationalistic than Islamist and it failed the Syrian Turkmen in their cause, what ISLAM would they lead? I'd rather a donkey lead the Islamic world than any of these clowns.

United States of America

Cyprus

Lmfao at ‘Saudi Arabia’. They have destroyed traditional mainstream sunni islam by spreading their heresies all over the world.

No country will be the leader. The question itself is wrong. But if you know people you can suggest.

None. Muslims should be lead by their respective nations.

KSA cant be leader of the muslim world cuz of all of the concerts and western things they are doing

None

Who tf said iran?

Turkey but only to piss off arabs

Nation states are irrelevant at that time so none of these. I will say whichever group is capable of defending Haramayn al Sharifayn can be considered the leader. I have my doubts on Saudi Arabs so will have to go with Turks on this one.

Isreal

The one with Nukes 😎

Indonesia

Imran Khan 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰

ew no turkey

Why u putting a non Muslim country in poll smh

Are we talking the government of the country or?

Pakistan/Malaysia/Indonesia/UK/Morroco/France

Pakistan because they have nukes

Loooll, Turkey is so fucking secular. Nothing islamic abt it anymore and it will decline more. I would say Egypt is more Islamic compared to the rest of those countries.

At the beginning of the 19th Century, there was a British Prime Minister who said "every country for itself and God for us all." That's reality. It's a jungle out there.

Everyone who voted for anything else other than None is delusional. Muslim world has no leader or unity and it never will have.

Indonesia

When it comes to Islam and what an Islamic society should look like Saudi is the winner. 

When it comes to Science and technology art and culture then Turkey is the winner.

Other: Mongolia 😍😂😼

None of them there should be a Mecca and Medina state just like the Vatican

Other, I'm going for Indonesia. It is the country with the largest Muslim population and it's set to become the 4th largest economy 2045. If I was to pick one of the listed countries it would be Saudi because of Mecca and Medina... This is just my opinion, I bet you have a really solid amount of reasoning for your opinion as well.

Somalia

Ukraïna

Jordan! 🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴

Michigan

I voted for Brunei.

Bosnia 🤣

whoever voted saudi occupied arabia... they destroyed and are destroying islam and never in history were of any significance to the islamic world nor culture. enshallh to the day the arabian peninsula will be freed of the sauf family

Its obvious that it should be Israel 🇮🇱

who have more money to waste for stupid un educated muslim countries should be leader.

The main reasons of Muslim countries are , everybody expecting something from others and nobody wants to be changed.

What are your thoughts on Zinedine Zidane and Imran Khan comparison? Two legends of their sports (association football and cricket respectively)?



Bro what are these posts man. 😂😂😂

Imran khan true kaliph shanshan raja imran 😍😍😍

Obligatory 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵on Immy Chad post.

Comparing Imran Khan to Zidane? One is a world superstar the other is a dethroned despot

Imran Khan looks bland infront of zinedine zidane

whats the comparison supposed to be in?

Do you think Imran Khan would look better with a beard?



he would look better in office

The caption “Edited image with hypothetical beard” is making me fucking howl

With a beard or without one but DANG he's one good looking dude!

🥵🥵🥵

Mashallah 🥹🫦

I am literally feeling things 🤤🥵

Imran Khan getting a beard is like gold-plating gold. He's already gold 🥰.

Does it even matter 🥵

May Allah forgive me 😫

I wish he would be back in office. The only real hope for Pakistan. Huh 😔

I mean 96.99% of men look better with a beard, so yeah obviously 🥵🥵

Imran where is beard? Beard is sunnah Imran

Imran Khan seriously looks alot like [Joaquim de Almeida](https://i.discogs.com/DfomRMHI6e1mgNFBKk20ScvLBfByT_mqlvO9E50IsxU/rs:fit/g:sm/q:40/h:300/w:300/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9BLTQxNDgw/MjMtMTQxODYwNzk5/NC02MzAwLmpwZWc.jpeg)

He looks half Jewish half French

2nd pic looks like how I used to look when I had longer hair

He's better either way. I would sacrifice my life for IMRAN KHAN.

Would look better if he was in power.

God why is imran khan the definition handsome🥵🥵

He looks like Shahrukh Khan in the second pic.

Who’s the most likable leader in the Middle East



Tamim bin hamad 🫡 rn but for all time i’d go with king faisal or zayed

Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is glorious leader

Imran Khan

The correct answer is probably Erdogan, if we're talking about who is most liked throughout all MENA countries. Although the bar is not very high and even Erdogan is fairly disliked.

Tamim bin Hamad, from what i saw here, I’m not sure why they love him, probably because u/sufficientAltfuel did a great job giving a good impression for his country .

Do you miss Imran khan?



Imi chan 🥺

Yess a lot I love this man with my life ♥

Based Pakistani ❤️🇵🇰

Zindabad Imran

Why’d they have to do him like that with the no confidence vote?! He was supposed to be Erdogan’s vizier when Pak-Turk empire is established!

He was kinda hot ngl

isn't there still a high chance that he'll return? I don't know that much about his policies, but I did like his speeches at the united nations a lot, he seemed very well spoken and intelligent

Yes

Of the biggest news channels in Pakistan (60-80% of total viewership) that was probably the only channel that was not spewing out anti-Imran Khan narratives has been banned effectively immediately for “perpetuating anti-state and anti-army sentiments”. Everyone has to use names like “Mr. X”, “The Establishment” or “Haji Baghlol Sahab” when referring to our Army Chief Qamar Javeed Bajwa or the top brass. 60% of our current federal cabinet is on bail from their crimes, including the prime minister himself, whose brother (our former PM) is also on bail and currently in England for “sickness”, and the decapitated peacock that is her daughter is also running around the nation for the past 2 years despite being a convicted convict and isn’t thrown back into jail despite. Nearly every major political party aside from Imran’s PTI has joined together in a coalition government but still barely holding on to control. Their begging trip across the world has given them zero loans from any country and they have the Army Chief call countries to negotiate loans (I am not joking. An army chief has to manage economic and foreign affairs). We are heading towards default and Sri Lanka type of bankruptcy. 

At least with Imran we had some sort of hope but now we’re completely f*cked. Can’t tell if it is America is doing a regime change through the Army or is it just everyone coming together to do anything in their power to cling onto their power, ignoring the fact they’re ripping the country apart

idk a single thing he did

Is any politician this influential in your country?



Actually i think this shows the absolute apathy of the world?The amount of aid they are sending is just insulting,its better to not send it all.overseas pakistanis have donated even more than this.like effing uk gave just 1.5million dollars.

Based Azerbaijan though

China is lower than I thought they would be

Politicians are anti-influential where I’m from, most people despise them

I'm surprised turkey didn't give anything, I thought they were considered brother nations

Thoughts on Imran Khan?



It looks like he's holding a Tokarev pistol.

I miss imrankhanlover

I only knew about him after he was sacked lol, unfortunate since Pakistanis seem to like him.

Banda kaisa hai woh toh nai pata lekin dikhta acha hai 💀💀

Don't care

He'z got nothing on the Babarsher 🐅🐅🐅

Turks, what will Pak Turk relations be like when CHP or some the new Government of Turkey comes in power.

I know it won't be the same, but at least some of the people who simp for Erdo as a Caliph will cry for him in Pakistan. At this moment in Pakistan, we are getting Imran Khan back at this moment. Sometimes, I wonder what will the relations be like? After, the refugees thing happened in the past 6 months. Lot of people on Reddit and Social Media in Turkey hate Pakistan a lot, seems like after 2023 election, Pak Turk relations will deteriorate, when the new government comes. Pakistan is willing to work with any government in Turkey, but it seems the new government of Turkey may have a great relation with Pakistan.

Yasa Mustafa Kemal Pasha

I don’t think it would change much. Pakistan and Turkey relations have always been good, long before Erdogan.

It is hard to say but it would be foolish to cancel established relations.

Our relations most likely won‘t change. Turkey and Pakistan always had pretty good relations as far as I know.

You know the way to our hearts lol

We never forget the good that has been done us and your people were some of the very few who helped us during our war of liberation, our darkest hour so thank you! We have to deal with our refugee/illegal immigration problems but our good relations will never change.

I doubt if relationships will deteriorate.

You wake up tomorrow and your country is being sold as an NFT, wwyd?



I’ll buy it and then I’ll rule the country 😎.

Buy it with 1 dolar that i have.

Thoughts on craiyon's attempt at draying Middle Eastern Leaders (Part 2)?



Hosni Mubarak will always be an ugly mfer no matter who draws or takes a photo of him

Imran Khan isn't ME bruh.

Who da cutest tho🥵

Terrifying

Is that, like, drawing and slaying? Cos he look like he got slayed.

Arafat looks like those crying cat memes

Do you think that you speak what your country thinks politically, in terms of rules and lawmaking? If yes or no please state why.

No, Pakistan is basically a mafia state for the rich to launder their money from various productive parts of the country either within their own rich gated communities within Pakistan or abroad in rich capitals around the world. They seek political power from majority poor and keep them illiterate or throw them a bone every now and then. Laws exist to counter it but the process is deliberately slow so people can never get justice. And as the saying goes "justice delayed is justice denied". When it goes to rich or political influential the courts will operate even at midnight to give them a favourable outcome. Speaking against this you'll either get ignored or abducted depending on how loud you shout. The army benefits mostly from this and the feudal lords.

No, as for reasons check my username and comment history

On somethings, yeah. I’m mainly moroccan &amp; I can clearly see the western influence on them. When I say them I refer to the people of Morocco heritage, I don’t know enough about the government.

I think the same way as my government 👍
I support everything they do

Thoughts on Imran Khan and Pervaiz Elahi (CM of Punjab)

Idk but Imran Khan bad

Share your favourite songs from your native language

I thaught it'll be interesting as middle east is home to countries with multiple ethnicities within one country 

A lot of time people here share songs from Thier "national" or mainstream languages but it'll be cool if people share songs from thier native languages or dialects 

Like I never heard a modern Kurdish song, it usually gets dominated by Farsi or Turkish music as that's the mainstream language of thier country, so it'll be interesting if y'all share songs from your native languages and show the diversity of middle eastern people groups! and as visitors we'll get to learn about your beautiful culture ❤️

Alright so Eventhough this is not a middle eastern language but to start of the thread in the right foot and get the thread going, I'll share my favourite songs from my native language Punjabi, all are from Pakistani singers

Disgraceful

Ex-PM Imran Khan arrested outside court in Pakistan



Let me just quickly write a list of former Pakistani leaders that haven’t been arrested:

According to videos on r/Pakistan the military has fired at protestors. This is gonna get a lot worse before it gets any better

Goddammit I am pretty sure shits gonna get out of control rq, I hope my exams aren't postponed......

Imran Khan seems to have been a much less corrupt politician and was better for his country overall than their current government.

This will go *swimmingly.*

Now the social media and internet is being blocked to hide protests.

So when does the rioting start?

Less arrested, more beaten up and thrown in a truck

Hope this doesn’t cause violence in Pakistan

They finally got him. 

They have been trying for a while now. 

I don't like Imran but he's got the military scared. Something very few leaders of Pakistan have been able to do. 

It's a dangerous game he is playing and I disagree with his beliefs but it's hard not to appreciate how he single handedly got the better of the establishment and the army. Especially for someone who had the moniker Im the Dim

Quick summary for people who don't follow Pakistani politics:

Factions in the Pakistani Army have been trying to assassinate/remove  ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan to make sure he has zero influence in Pakistan, as Imran Khan is running campaigns to weed out blatant corruption in the very corrupt country. 

If any elections were to be held Imran Khan would win by a landslide as the opposing party is openly corrupt (more-so) and the current party will do anything for certain factions within the Pakistani army as long as they get to fill their backpockets. 

- Note that he is currently the "ex" PM as there was suspected pressure to oust him by western governments, due to Pakistan trying to secure cheap oil/grain from Russia directly during the start of the Ukraine fiasco. Pakistan tried to secure this deal as their economy is struggling (but this should be their right to do so as a independent nation and not a vassal of larger western nations). 

- The opposing party (who had corruption cases against them) ousted imran khan in a coup, but couldn't kill him due to potential instability it would cause (Imran Khan is extremely popular). The corruption charges for the current ruling party were dropped as soon as they came into power. 

- 6 months ago while giving a speech there was an assassination attempt on Imran Khans life (there are videos floating around) as Imran Khans party is seen was still seen as disruptive to the current corrupt status quo and the current administration see that their currently hold on power will most likely be short lived.

- Historically only a few political families have led pakistan, Imran Khan does not belong to any of these families.

- Today, another attempt to try to silence Imran Khan is causing protests across the country as the current pakistani government/army are trying to secure their corrupt status quo.

Soon to be another dead Pakistani prime minister… Something that is very common in this country

Everything started going downhill hill for him ever since he told merica he will continue doing business with Russia

I’m scared of another Muslim country being at war smh

Correction, he was arrested inside the court.

Interesting hot take from a site that seems pretty biased: [https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/pakistan-imran-khan-arrest-dark-day-democracy](https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/pakistan-imran-khan-arrest-dark-day-democracy)

Was more evidence openly planted at his residence while he was in the courthouse?

Just some context about the Taliban leader from last time he was getting arrested. He's done a lot worse, just a quick list I posted before:

* said [Taliban's 'holy war' in Afghanistan is justified by Islamic law](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/14/imran-khan-taliban-afghanistan-islam)
   * He said this just 1 week after Malala Yousafzai, the 14-year-old activist, was shot in the head by the Taliban for supporting girls' education. While visiting the hospital Malala was brought to after being shot (she was not there when he arrived).
* was [selected by Taliban as a member of five-man team to represent them in 'peace' talks with the government](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26008815).
* [joined forces with Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Sami (JUI-S)](https://asiatimes.com/2018/01/pakistans-main-opposition-party-allies-taliban-seminary/)
   * JUI-S is the political wing of the Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary, renowned for being the alma mater of Taliban leaders of past and present. It is led by Sami-ul-Haq, the Islamist cleric known fondly as the ‘Father of the Taliban.’
   * “Imran Khan has ensured that the PTI’s rallying cry will be the implementation of Sharia law,” a PTI member told Asia Times.
   * “While we continue to support the struggle overseas, it is important to implement a truly Islamic system in Pakistan as well. And in PTI we have a willing partner that has already taken steps towards Islamization in KP.”

Pakistan military has always been controlled by the United States... and they have played a dual game where they support extremists both these nations in the region... against the desires of the Pakistani public

Here goes all the social media restrictions and the riots now.

The reason that not a single Pakistan PM has completed his term is because whenever a PM actually tried to do development and amend relations with neighbouring India, the military and foreign agents (wanting instability in the subcontinent) overthrow him.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I don't know enough about Pakistani politics to have an opinion on this.

This dude was the one sucking up to china?

The allegations against him are: "the PTI chief and his wife obtained billions of rupees from a real estate firm for legalizing a laundered amount of Rs50 billion that was identified and returned to the country by the UK during the previous PTI government". Still, it's funny how Imran Khan gets arrested not long after Donald Trump, who he is often compared with for both being populist leaders. Who's next? Bolsonaro? Also, keep in mind this post will be brigaded by his supporters, so redditors if you want an unbiased opinion piece on Imran Khan read the recent TIME magazine article on him: https://time.com/6267954/imran-khan-pakistan-prime-minister-exclusive/

Does this have anything to do with the lynching for blasphemy that happened at a rally of Imran Khan's party recently?

Kaaaaaahn!

What do you  mean, Vern?

Imran Khan's supporters storm Pakistan army headquarters, chant slogans against establishment - Times of India



As an Indian, I am glad a large portion of Pakistanis finally understand what the Pakistan Army has done to their country.

The Pakistan military has never won a war but they have made themselves the centre of Pakistan. 

Ammassed huge amounts of ill gotten wealth. And created a business empire.

Sponsored terrorism both inside and outside Pakistan. 

Constantly assassinated political figures who have dared to challenge them. 

Keeps selling ordinary Pakistanis that they can wrest away Kashmire in India, while they lose authority in Balochistan and northern parts of Pakistan to separatists and terrorists.

While average Pakistanis are rioting over a bag of flour, these entitled assholes live in lavish cantonments surrounded by every possible luxury.

And let's not forget the genocide they conducted against Bengalis of East Pakistan.

There is no institution in South Asia as vile as the Pakistan Army.

The current government and the army have lost the plot.

Do we foresee a large unrest

I’m curious what Pakistanis have to say on this.  Khan’s arrest seems like the world’s biggest news today.

OK. Before anyone comments, this is what I know from watching the videos

Attacking Army headquarters is a big thing and I mean full stop big thing. Rawalpindi is the go-to headquarters of Pakistan armed forces and establishment as a whole. As establishment rules the country, attacking the headquarters is a big thing. There are also reports of terrorist groups like Pakistan Taliban and Al Queda among them are taking advantage. If this happens that means there is a chance of civil war. If it does, then it's bad because Pakistan is a nuclear armed country. Imagine terrorists of all people having nuclear weapons. Yeah 2023 is going to be a blast

Anyone from Pakistan or who has family there that can comment on this? I want your opinion

Imran Khan's arrest was illegal - Supreme Court



Hate to ask, but does anyone have a quick ELI5 for this? Did read the article, but I’m not seeing what charges he was arrested under, and it’s decent journalism because it’s so factual and anodyne that if I wanted to “pick a side” (and I don’t, it’s not necessary), I’d have no idea who’s who.

US, UK wash their hands off Imran Khan, want rule of law to be followed in Pakistan



Of*

Unless he's a faucet of bodily fluids

The guy was rabid anti US /anti west. 

Wouldn't make a lot of sense for those countries to burn the bridges with only people in pakistan who are somewhat pro west.

The US and UK will support the junta as they have historically

Hell, I'd like the rule of law followed in the US!

when internet was suspended in pakistan it is rule of law when it was done in kashmir it is human rights violation. there should be a limit to hypocrisy

The guy was arrested after embezzling govt money. Youthias crying and rioting all over the place.

Why would they give a fuck about Imran Khan when he's a CCP shill? Why don't he ask the CCP for help?

US and UK do not care about corrupt Taliban Khan.

You would think the same would apply to the us and uk with their blatant lies and stealing of tax payers money.

Imran Khan accuses Pakistan’s military of ordering his arrest | Pakistan



Why does the Pakistani military have so much influence over the country’s politics?

For all his populist aspirations and all his faults, its hard to imagine he can ever rule again when Pakistan's military disapproves, given their influence over politics.

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan arrested



Less of an arrest and more of a kidnapping. The army has fallen to new lows, but it’s not surprising. At this point I’m hoping for mass protests, if we don’t bring change now by force then it will never come. 

Easy for me to say, though, as someone who is not actually there. I just hope my brothers and sisters can stay safe. Things will get ugly.

Imagine being so terrified of someone, you essentially plot a coup to get them dismissed as PM, conspire to not allow them to hold public office for 5 years and he's still so popular you have to resort to arrest him on some weird ass trumped up charges...

But hey, to all Sharif bradraan supporters. Enjoy I guess. Here's to another glorious Sharif brothers rule. /s

clownsic pakistan moment.

Pakistan… more like *Backslide*istan.

Yo they really liked this guy I hear

Good, now arrest the shareef and the zardari clan

Ex-PM Imran Khan calls for ‘freedom’ protests across Pakistan



WIth how much the western governments talk about China's Tiananmen Square protests. Their silence when Pakistan's going through the same speaks volume about their hypocrisy. Why because the democratic movement does not agree with their policies

The Army is not gonna let him live. He will likely end up like Benazir Bhutto or her father.

Pakistan considering banning Imran Khan’s party: Defence minister



That's how Pakistan's government is preparing for the elections later this year.

To be fair, outlawing the main opposition is their only chance at coming out ahead, so who can blame them?

As long as Pakistan milltary and ISI is running the country , actions like this will be the norm,  and everyone cheering on democracy on world news will be  trying to explain this one away.

Pakistan's billionaire generals will the the country's undoing

I thought this was Ted Nugent at first

Pakistan's Prime Minister ordered authorities arrest all those who were involved in violent protests over the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan earlier this week. Sharif gave security forces 72 hours to round them up, adding that perpetrators would be tried in anti-terrorism courts



So after shutting down the internet where the military and police killed and beat dozens of people, and illegally arrested Khan, they now are going to say that those people protesting are "terrorists"

Huh sounds like fascism to me.

Why did they arrest Khan again, oh yea there was an election they were about to lose in 3 days

If it looks like a fascist and acts like one, it probably is one

I'll say this. In my 30 years of living, I've never seen the ruling parties whoce robbed the people out of billions for decades, be that the army, Zardaris/Bhuttos or the Sharifs be so fucking terrified of one man.

I mean, if they only arrested the people who were actually setting shit on fire, that'd be understandable. But I somehow doubt that this will be so limited.

Just a token move

Pakistan's Supreme Court has ruled that former PM Imran Khan's arrest earlier this week was illegal and that he should be released immediately



Will they actually release him, or will they extrajudicially keep him hostage?

The opposition accused him of evading the law. 

....and he was arrested outside of a court because he was either attending or had already done so.

Ah yes another bingo square.

At least some protest against Army. Irrespective of how corrupt or incompetent a political leader is they are far better than a military government. In the former cases people still have control over the corrupt politicians but not over their military. It is time Pakistan show military where their place is. I wish it came due to a political leader better than Imran who was a stooge of the military

Pakistan ex-PM Imran Khan says police surrounded his house, arrest imminent



This guys dressed like he’s about to say “this is the ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs”

For those who want to know about the current situation in Pakistan:  
Khan was ousted on the 9th of April, 2022. Since April 2022, the Govt of Pakistan has registered more than 150 FIRs against him and most of them are related to terrorism and sedition.   
In November, a religious fanatic attempted to murder him. Khan wasn't allowed to register an FIR against all those who planned the murder attempt, even after the court's order.  
After his last abduction when the Rangers abducted him from court without a warrant, massive protests have been started in the country which killed around 70 PTI workers. So far, seven thousand workers have been abducted from all over the country.  
Video Link for the abduction: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G81Za6kU4NQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G81Za6kU4NQ)

Not a good look. A country with a population over 200 million, slowly descending into a failed state.

Pakistan's former PM Imran Khan is in a standoff with authorities who have surrounded his house. In his first interview since a police deadline expired, Khan said an "unprecedented crackdown is taking place."



Pakistan  a political mess, played both sides in the Afghan war, supports terrorism in Khasmir, Afghanistan, and India, is in economic turmoil and have been pivoting towards China and Turkey in recent years, and at times cozied up to Russia, and cant even control cast swaths of it own territories, I think we need the us needs to fully pivot away from Pakistan , and Towards India (despite any faults we disagree on with the modi government), India could also play a role in the de-coupling from China, and it intellgence agency a great help in the fight against terrorists in south asia, on stuff happening in China, and on Putin Russia.

this will gain him a ton of public support now... something the opposition is not that fond of considering how hated the current pm is by the general public

This will probably give Imran Khan a huge boost in support.

It’s really not fun to be former anything in pakistan

I wonder how this will effect the stability of the nation, especially in the context of the suspicion surrounding the recent death of that reporter who was identified as a supporter of Khan.

As the world gets more destructive we’re gonna see more politicians get attacked and targeted

Imran Khan throwing leeches in the fire right now:

~ the usurper Shehbaz Sharif

~ the usurper Rana Sanaullah

~ the usurper Major General &lt;redacted&gt;

Fuck the army and Pakistan’s slave owning political dynasties. 

It’s amazing how the west has given its blessing to a democratic coup run by the army and corrupt dynasties. 

Ever since they were put in power, you never even hear about half the shit they pull in western media outlets.

And now these billionaire politicians have resorted to assassination attempts on political rivals who want to prosecute them for corruption.

P.s: for those unaware, these supposedly rival dynasties have all joined together/bought politicians to form a minority government. The leaders of these parties have been in power for decades and own millions in assets abroad. They have also manipulated courts to terminate any corruption lawsuits against themselves. The west doesn’t report on any of it.

Edit: Apparently not an AK

Any leader that has ever truly challenged military supremacy in Pakistan or tried steer Pakistan out of US influence has ended up ousted and/or dead.

All of our most popular leaders have ended up executed or murdered.

Liaquat Ali Khan our first PM was shot dead in Rawalpindi, 1951 after deciding that Pakistan should have balanced relations with the Soviet Union and before his trip there.

Fatima Jinnah, sister of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan said to have died of unnatural causes in Karachi, 1967 after losing the elections despite having won the popular vote against Gen. Ayub Khan. 

In 1971, Mujibur Rahman was kept from forming government despite having won the elections with overwhelming majority and the following nine months of civil war and an Indian invasion resulted in the creation of Bangladesh out of East Pakistan.

Later almost all of Mujib's family including himself were slaughtered by the Bangladesh Army's coup in 1975.

Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto hanged by military in Rawalpindi two years after the '77 coup, after not compromising on a French nuclear reactor deal despite US pressure and tilting towards the Soviet Union and China.

General Zia-ul-Haq while not exactly a popular democratic leader, he was starting to make choices that the US didn't agree with, died in a C-130 crash in 1988, alongwith high profile military and civilian personnel including the Pakistani Chairman Joint Chiefs, a US ambassador, and a US military attaché.

Benazir Bhutto, daughter of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto shot dead in Liaquat Bagh, Rawalpindi, 2007.

All of these deaths except for Zulfiqar and Mujeeb are unsolved to this day. 

(Note that Liaquat Bagh was where Liaquat Ali Khan was killed and is named after him, and the same parties that helped coup Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto are involved in removing Imran Khan and are literally the children of the previous party heads, the overall script used by the army is also the same as the one used in '77 when Bhutto was removed.

Khan wasn't really anti-US, he had good relations with the Trump administration, but the Biden administration went out of its way to not engage him.

Biden didn't speak with him, didn't invite him to some gatherings, and was being unusually cold towards him and his government.

The Pakistani military, sent Khan off to Russia on the day that it invaded Ukraine and then specifically told the US that Imran made that decision on his own, which pissed the Americans off and made them greenlight the domestic coup.

All the political parties and the Military Establishment got together and colluded in taking Khan out of office but this time people are refusing to accept it, because unlike those before him Imran was both honest, non-corrupt and a competent leader running an effective government.

Surveys, reports and all recent by elections point towards Imran Khan getting 80% of the vote this time giving him atleast a 2/3 majority that would allow him to even change the constitution.

The corrupt dynastic parties that went through hell the last four years when he only had a crippled coalition government and the military establishment that see themselves losing all control do not want this to happen.

They've taken to fascist tactics that haven't even been used in Pakistan's worst martial laws (except probably in East Pakistan).

They've charged Imran with contempt of court (if found guilty then you can't be in parliament), and terrorism for threatening to file a case on chief and deputy chief Islamabad Police and a judicial magistrate for allowing his chief of staff to be tortured and sexually abused in police custody and the judge ignoring the signs of torture on the man and giving him back into police custody for more torture.

When news got out of plans to arrest Khan some time after midnight, hundreds of people including women and children surrounded his estate to act as barrier for police, and protests broke out all over the country spontaneously with entire families coming out in the middle of the night and staying out until he was granted pre-arrest bail. This happened twice. 

They assassinated one of Pakistan's top investigative journalists, and the host of the ARY News show "Power Play", who was in self-exile in Kenya after facing shambolic cases and credible death threats in Pakistan and being deported from UAE because of pressure from the Pakistani government. 

Now they tried assassinating him too. 

If Imran wins this struggle, which by all means it looks like he can, then Pakistan becomes a democracy for real. If he loses then Pakistan continues to be a more camouflaged version of Egypt and Myanmar.

Unsurprising to be honest

I feel like this could ruin his cricket career.

Why is ‘Assassination Attempt’ in quotes? No one shoots a PM in the leg for shits and giggles, just jolly good times yeh? It’s *always* an assassination attempt. No need to wrap it in suspicious looking quotes, as if there may be some *other* cause.

Did you get shot in the army?

No I got shot in the leggy.

Could be his Reagan moment. I'd like to see those automatic weapons come out from underneath his security details trenchcoats though. That grainy Reagan video was wild for sure...

The military with absolutely no respect for will of the people

Idk I visited Pakistan when khan was pm, and I gotta say the Crack down on corruption was insane. For reference I was there in 2011. From the airport to touring all of sindh province not one official tried to extort me, nor did any of my family members report any robberies which were pretty common before. It was a very enjoyable vacation since the country felt very safe and professional. In 2011 me and my family waited until daylight to travel home after I arrived to the airport, no such thing last year

"assassination attempt"

"Shot in leg"

Who'd they send, the stormtrooper?

majority of politcal and us backed army elite living in nyc or london. they all act 'woke' in the West but live in lavish houses islamabad and rawalpindi sexually abusing their poor maids and slapping around their busboys.

&amp;#x200B;

time for the revolution

Ah ffs. Keep Imran Khan safe :(

I used to be a prime minister like you, then i took a bullet to the knee

It was a little sleazy and destabilizing what they did to Imran.

Did they order the assassin from wish?

If a former head of state can be shot at so brazenly in a rally no one can be considered safe. I hope he has a speedy recovery. Ps: it’s super sus that the shooter has already been caught allegedly and there’s a video of him saying he did it of his own accord on Twitter. ISI really pulling a lot of strings lol

Long live Imran Khan, may Allah protect him. The closest thing to a good man in Pakistani politics.

Tear gas fired outside ex-Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s residence | Imran Khan News



Police action comes a day after Islamabad court issued arrest warrants for former Prime Minister Imran Khan in alleged corruption and ‘terrorism’ cases.(The tear gas is being fired at Imran Khan's supporters, who are attempting to block the Pakistani police from arresting Imran Khan).

This is still ongoing.

Imran Khan is the only honest leader in Pakistan, and the government is trying their best to eliminate him.

They are trying to delay elections in 2 provinces. Already they are delayed by more than Pakistans constitution allows, and they want to make it even more, or prevent them from happening this year at all.

It’s not just about arresting him. They have been torturing prisoners, making videos of them naked, and even killed one prisoner in custody. 

They have used brute force against people trying to protect him - expired tear gas shells. Water cannons with chemicals added to them.

currently the country is run by the corrupt military and politicians. Imran Khan is the only one in their way. they are going to remove him.

Not just tear gas! Live bullets are being fired! Fascist army showing it's true colors!

Imran Khan's most memorable statements

1. "I will never forget how we Pakistanis were embarrassed when the Americans came into Abbottabad and killed Osama bin Laden, martyred him,"

2. A day after the Taliban seized power in Kabul in August 2021 and Ashraf Ghani fled the war-torn country, Khan said Afghans have "broken the chains of slavery in the country"

3. Just hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine in late February, Imran Khan arrived in Moscow with all smiles. “What a time to come, so much excitement,

4. "If a woman is wearing very few clothes it will have an impact on the men unless they are robots. It's common sense,"

5. "Sexual crimes are on the rise due to the misuse of mobile phones,"

Imran Khan has unprecedented support on ground level, in the history of Pakistan. 

The people are fed up with status quo and the army constantly bending to American will at the expense of their own nation. Something is going to change.

Former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan arrested in graft case



Mr Smith goes to Islamabad

Pakistani court frees former Prime Minister Imran Khan



&gt;Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan left a high court in Islamabad on Friday after being granted broad protection from arrest in multiple legal cases against him. The ruling struck a blow to the government in a stand-off that has sparked days of rioting by Khan’s followers and raised the specter of widespread unrest in the country.

&gt;After the court granted him bail, Khan spent hours more in the building, as he and his legal team were locked in apparent negotiations over his exit from the site.

&gt;As he headed to his home in the eastern city of Lahore, Khan put out a video statement from his vehicle saying the Islamabad police tried to keep him within the courthouse through different tactics, and authorities allowed him to travel only when he threatened to tell the public he was being held there against his will.

Some more details here:

https://www.dawn.com/news/1740527/imran-dodges-arrest-after-islamabad-police-show-up-at-lahore-residence-with-court-summons

&gt; What we know so far

&gt; - Islamabad Police arrived at Imran’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore around 12:30pm to arrest him
- They were met by a large amount of PTI workers, who massed outside his residence on Fawad Chaudhry’s call
- Non-bailable arrest warrants were issued by a sessions court judge for Imran’s persistent no-shows in Toshakhana case hearings
- Police said those who obstruct arrest will be prosecuted
- Islamabad police chief said won’t go back empty-handed
- PTI threatened mass protests if arrest goes through
- Rana Sanaullah said Imran’s arrest was on court orders, and not the government’s
- Police left Zaman Park at around 1:30pm
- Imran addressed party workers at Zaman Park residence a little before 5pm
- Party approached LHC for protective bail but could not file
- PTI requests CJP to allow Imran to appear before various courts “virtually”

Imran Khan is the local populist politician like Modi, Bolsonaro, or Trump. During the last decade, he normalized things like mass protests if he doesn't get his way, arresting of opposition leaders when his government is in power (without proof), and making outright lies to win votes (e.g. American conspiracy to kick him out). Right now the current government is using most of the tactics he invented against him. This seems to be taking most of their time, and right now there isn't a single political party in the country that I can point at and say they have their priorities right.

I am Indian, and I can't believe Imran Khan is corrupt. He is a womanising, POS. But I think he is smart and would have administered well

That does seem suspicious.

The guy and his wife auctioned the gifts he got and pocketed the money. Now crying about it and using his party thugs to evade arrest. He and His wife also bought back a lot of things including a necklace she was gifted, from the Toshakhana at a fraction of its market price.

Imran Khan booked by Rangers outside IHC in Al-Qadir Trust case



‘Either Imran Khan exists or we do’, says Pakistan home minister | Imran Khan News



&gt; “He accuses us of plotting to kill him, and if he thinks we want to kill him, obviously he wants to kill us as well,” he said.

Lol what?

How about they compromise and both stop existing.

The current government is no more than an organised criminal gang. IK is higher only political leader that speaks for proper rule of law and that’s why they are after him. 

This statement by the minister is a clear indication of their intentions. They don’t care about democracy or any law any more.

Saying the quiet part out loud. I may not agree with all of Imrans policies but the current government and their cronies are nothing more than criminals that have destroyed any chance that Pakistan can rise from the ashes.

I will say some of this is likely translation errors.

Urdu/Hindi are two languages where the meaning of a word is heavily dependent on the context. 

It's maddening to learn lol.

Pakistan: Police enter former PM Imran Khan’s residence after he leaves for court hearing in Islamabad. "As many as 10,000 Punjab police took part in the operation," government tells reporters.



Videos show police officers carrying in black bags and the same officers be captured by paid reporters who brought along showing the bags being pulled out.

Video of police trying to hide what looks to be Molotov cocktails under their shirts.

The Police Inspector General just held a press conference showing "Molotov cocktails" in plastic water bottles, others are claiming an "arsenal of weapons" also.

But the media themselves showcased weapons being carried into the house and out.

Just days ago the government was spreading ethnic conflict by claiming police from another province pointed weapons at Punjab police. The IG had to come and claim this was false and would never happen because of the requirements of the "police uniform".

Pakistani TV channels banned from broadcasting the speeches, press conferences, and statements of former prime minister Imran Khan



I was curious to see if Pakistan had freedom of speech in its constitution 

&gt; Every citizen shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression, and there shall be freedom of the press, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law

So in principle it’s there, but it appears that in practice it is not. I wonder how the country’s judicial system interprets the above…

I still can’t figure this out. When I was a kid, he was such a stellar and admirable cricketer. I don’t know if he’s the asshole or it’s politics-as-usual bullshit that’s smearing him


(Edit: changed “figure HIM out” to “figure THIS out”)

Things are getting more complicated over there.

Looks like Imran Khan won't be getting much air time on Pakistani TV channels anymore. I wonder what he did to get himself banned?

Imran khan is probably the last hope for Pakistan. At this point a civil war to settle it all would be necessary. But a country with warheads going into a civil war would be very troublesome; a bunch of world powers will get involved. Worst thing is, it would even pose as a slight trigger to WW3.

Pakistan's police pull back from Imran Khan's home after clashes with his supporters



Seeing his name a lot recently. Anyone kind enough to explain?

Khan's supporters hurled rocks and used sticks against the officers, at one point even lobbing a firebomb, as they formed a shield around Khan's home in a leafy upscale suburb of the Pakistani city of Lahore. "These are workers that are actually battling the police," says Arifa Noor, a columnist for the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. The police, she says, "did not estimate this kind of resistance."

Don’t tell the Republicans. They believe January 6th was ‘legitimate political discourse’ and violence is the only way for Republicans to win when they lose.

Says one of the most covertly violent political systems in the world. 🤦🏻‍♂️

Thomas Jefferson would disagree.  

"And can history produce an instance of a rebellion so honourably conducted? I say nothing of it’s motives. They were founded in ignorance, not wickedness. God forbid we should ever be 20. years without such a rebellion.[1] The people can not be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is a lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. We have had 13. states independant 11. years. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century and a half for each state. What country before ever existed a century and half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve it’s liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."

I haven't followed this or the man. But as someone completely ignorant to Pakistan, except maybe of the reputation for horrendous treatment of women, it's really difficult to tell what's what with this guy.

The stories that come out could either be because he is a mostly good man that became an inconvenience to the rich and corrupt, or he was just as bad but his rabid fans and true believers are spreading their version of things to make him look like a victim.

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan slams ministers for rash remarks against Taliban



Imran Khan is also the proponent of Good Taliban-Bad Taliban theory.

Aww man all they did was blow up couple of schools. No need to be rash!

Trash state run propaganda with a misleading headline that is at complete odds with what is being said.

His position has been the same for 20 years now. Their is no real military solution in Afghanistan, use dialogue with whoever is in charge.

Reality is the military has funded and supported the taliban. Military dictator did it in the 2000s, and the the ones "working" with civilian leaders followed that policy. This is a military policy through and through that is forced on people.

The province that directly shares a border with Afghanistan is where IK initial base is from, so he knows full well the direct effects of terrorism. 

The entire gist of what is being said is here

&gt;The PTI chairman warned that another war against terrorism would become a curse for the country if relations with Afghanistan deteriorated...“If terrorism is not dealt with seriously, it could have dangerous consequences for the country and that too at a time when our economic conditions cannot bear it at all,” he warned.

Basically they cannot afford another protracted war, the people don't want it, and it will likely yield no benefits.

The rumor in Pakistan is the military wants to do a large scale operation in Afghanistan in hopes of getting US aid. That aid will only partially be used for counterterrorism, most will be used to further strengthen political control (just like the majority of the aid did from 2000-2010)

Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan booked under anti-terrorism charges



What specifically did he say ?? Can I get an exact quote in punjab and a machine translation ?

There is no world where this ends well, ever.

Isn’t he also the the major opposition candidate? This does not bode well.

If someone is wondering what is happening, he started saying the real truth as how police officials, judges and army is fucking with the country, nothing else.

Anti Terrorism as in he was against terrorism so they booked him /s

- Complete media blackout 

- YouTube distuptions

- Attack on activists, journalists by the state

- Illegal abduction of Shahbaz Gill by the state (We Can't Breathe)

- 25 May 2022

I've always been mystified by Pakistan.  
Why do they kill their former leaders?

The day his party wins a byelection

The government can't arrest him because literally 90% of the country supports him.

Since when has saying you are going to file a case against police been considered terrorism? This US puppet gov is desperate.

What you are seeing here is the end of Democracy in Pakistan and the beginning of fascism. However, what is upsetting me the most is that no news media is covering this major event over here.

The military establishment and fascist government are trying to arrest the most popular leader in Pakistani history as we speak and international media is completely silent. Are they fucking insane? You can't silence the will of the masses through force, this might be the start of mass civil disobedience like never seen before in Pakistan.

We need help in Pakistan. We're facing the worst form of dictatorship. Please help spread this message

Is there anyone that can give me an unbiased take on what's going on with him and Pakistan in general?

TIL that threatening to take legal action is terrorism.

Pakistan is under a fascist regime that would put Burma to shame.

Looks like Pakistan is returning to military rule and the end of a nominal civilian government.

If he's assassinated, it's over. Pakistan can try again to improve in another 30 years. If he makes it out of this alive, I'm sure PTI will do a clean sweep.

Except in sindh lmao because bhutto will be personally stuffing those ballot boxes

Seems like after being the PM of Pakistan, the next step is a jail cell.

and this is how you get Civil War.

This fascist govt and their military backers are trying to stop Khan but the guy is extremely popular right now. They are delusional if they think they can stop this.

To anyone who’s like WTF?
This is the Military and fascist Kleptocrats trying to bring down a popular leader who has support of the people and can start a revolution to destroy everything they have built by subversion and oppression and effectively take their ability to loot the nation away. 

It’s effectively the people VS Fascism in Pakistan.

Imran khan is a rat and I can’t wait to see him in prison.

Fact : Pakistan is ruled by it's military and democratic government has to abide the rules dictated by Pak Army.


**Western Media is not talking because they don't care about the man as he has been quite anti-west in last few months. He wanted to remain neutral like India in Ukraine - Russia war.**

**After he was forced to go , he has constantly criticised Pakistan Army, US and praised Indian Government because of their resistance to toe the U.S. Political line despite being strategic allies, he went as far as playing India EAM's statment in his rally.**

Which Pakistan Army did not like due to pressure from D.C.  

**As per what I've understood in Pakistan media coverage, he was removed by Pak Army due to pressure from D.C. as Pak needs urgent IMF loans and US threatened sanctions.  Pak Army wants the IMF Money and also favours in Indo-Pak conflict as they know that India is beyond their reach. They also caused huge embarrassment for Biden by supporting Taliban in taking over and then being first and I guess only  government to recognise them.**

**U.S. was their biggest ally even bigger than China then Obama second term and Trump happened and now U.S is strongly and firmly allied with India and recently US has offered heavily modified F35s to India as well their most sensitive military hardwares with ToT.**


Pak Army has realised that China won't actively participate in the conflict as India is the biggest US ally and weapons customer after non-nato, non-pacific nations.

 **Fun Fact - India accidentally launched it's stripped down version of Brahmos during routine maintenance on a trajectory targeting their military base, their Chinese SAMs failed to fire let alone intercept. Also their Chinese Jets were quite ineffective against Indian AF and it's F16 and AMRAMs that saved their dignity.**

***Western Media is silent because this time it's West again interfering with Democracy in South-West Asia and South Asia. The buffoons in Pakistan politics are highly corrupt individuals who will sell their Soul to the highest bidder that's not Israeli or Indian because associating with these nations will kill their career as these are nations are why Pak Army justifies itself. Pakistan Army is the biggest user of government budget."***

I'm sorry for the formatting, this is my opinion based on what I've seen in Pakistani media and South Asian politics.

Surprise Surprise  they couldn't get anything on him and are booking for standing up to the american installed prime minster meanwhile people are told its their fault that pakistan is in economic ruin because they had 1 too many cups of chai

Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan blames establishment figures for plot to kill him



People need to understand what Pakistan has become. After decades of military coups and foreign aid to them, the "establishment" top branch of the military has more power than anyone else. 

They rule the country as a pseudo-fascist state

Their is an illusion of elections which they manipulate and break governments that speak against them, their is an illusion of free press which they heavily censor and propagandize, their is an illusion of freedom to do what you want unless you speak against the state and you are picked up and beaten senseless

Everyone is essentially powerless against them because they can easily blackmail the judiciary and police to pick you up in the middle of the night and torture you.

That's what Imran is now fighting against...fascism and military rule. He naively thought he could reform within or they wanted to change. It's not possible.

These are the people that tried to assassinate him. Even naming them in the media is taboo, because the illusion is the most important part.

Imran named an ISI general directly and now they are in full panic and trying to spin it in the media, Imran is the bad guy even though he almost got killed. You can't gaslight the world

Jot blaming the CIA for once , amazing

Imran khan thinks these guys are possibly behind the shooting

Shehbaz Sharif, PM

Rana Sanaullah, Interior Minister

Major General Faisal Naseer, DG ISI


These guys probably are behind it especially the military!

Want Dignified Ties For Pakistan That US Has With India: Imran Khan

Hundreds of people showed up outside Imran Khan's hilltop mansion in Islamabad to protest against any orders for his arrest. The former prime minister was charged under the country's anti-terror laws over the weekend



No Prime Minister in Pakistan has ever served his complete 5 year term

Let me explain for people: 
Imran Khan was ousted by a coalition of parties led by two main parties which themselves are led by the political dynasties of the Bhuttos and Sharifs with support of the military. Imran Khan founded his party in the 90s and slowly worked up over the years to winning the elections in 2018. He ran on a platform of anti-corruption populism and at the time of the 2018 elections, was in the military’s good books, otherwise he would have never won. The military implicitly control all of Pakistan, but they let a civilian government lead. The military exist on US aid, so as Imran Khan was moving Pakistan further away from the USA and more towards China, he began to lose military favour. They basically gave a go ahead to the Bhuttos and Sharifs to form an alliance an kick Imran Khan out. What they didn’t expect is how popular Imran Khan is among Pakistanis, so mass protests immediately broke out calling for elections. The ruling elite of Pakistan are having a hard time withholding elections but are also aware they would lose to Imran Khan’s party, so they’re doing everything they can to delegitimise him.

I would also like to clarify on perceptions of Imran Khan:

&gt;He is the Pakistani Trump

Untrue. I admit he relies on religious populist rhetoric, but he is far from Trump. Khan has support from the most secular liberal Pakistani to the average uneducated Pakistani villager, because everyone is fed up with the level of corruption in Pakistan and can see he is sincere about fixing the country.

&gt;He is also a corrupt elitist

Khan isn’t perfect but he is far from corrupt. When the non-elected government took place after Khan’s ousting they did their best to find dirt on him, they couldn’t. They managed to convict members of his party, but the most they could accuse him of was receiving a rolex as a gift. In r/Pakistan the general consensus on Imran Khan is that his party had corrupt members and even if Khan himself wasn’t corrupt, can he change the country when his own party members are? But even still, we agreed that he himself isn’t.

Edit: I should also clarify, I don’t particularly like Imran Khan’s politics. I hate his foreign policy, I think its too anti-west. I hate his populist rhetoric, he basically dabbles into Islamist talking points, making himself to be some kind of resistance leader against the ‘evil’ west. I have a dislike for his domestic economics (its not objectively bad, but differs from my personal view). But despite that, I don’t doubt his sincerity of wanting what is best for Pakistan and the average Pakistani. He is the only realistic potential leader who isn’t corrupt.

Another reminder why Pakistan is barely a functional state.

Pakistan: Arrest warrant issued for former PM Imran Khan



He will not cricket his way out of this one

Wow, what...? And who's who tries to replace him now?

It's apparently over statements he made at a campaign rally.

&gt; The PTI chief had made the controversial remarks during a party rally in the capital on August 20 and was subsequently booked for “terrorism” under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.

&gt; Imran alleged that Additional Sessions Judge Zeba Chaudhry knew that party leader Shahbaz Gill was tortured, but she did not release him on bail. He threatened that he would take legal action against the judge and the Inspector general of Islamabad police.

&gt; Several sentences from Imran’s speech were made part of the FIR. It said that Imran Khan’s speech in this design and style was aimed at spawning fear and panic among the police authorities, the judiciary and the public.

&gt; It added that Imran’s threat of “filing a case against you” had spread fear among the police authorities, the judiciary and the public and destroyed the peace in the country.

Ohhh seems like shit is going down on Pakistan

Pakistan elections board bars Imran Khan from public office



The Supreme Court will have to trash this decision on prior precedent.

The Election Commission doesn't have the powers to make such a decision, there are 3 Supreme Court rulings that state this.

Also even if not, he is only barred from public office for the duration of the current assemblies and will be able to run for office when the next general elections are started.

They did this just days after Khan sweeped the by-elections on his party's weakest constituencies where the 13 party opposition to his party, now united under the banner of the PDM had a FAR larger combined vote bank in 2018.

He won 6 out of 7 seats setting a record in Pakistan by outdoing Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's 5 seats, Bhutto was previously considered the most popular leader that Pakistan ever had.

The only seat that Khan lost was after his representatives in that constituencies were attacked, one was killed and the other had his skull cracked open, and local police showed up to help the government goons to rig the elections, a lot of people found that they had already voted, and in a lot of places there were no ballots right from the beginning apparently all having already been used up for votes. 

After this decision people are now out and rioting all over Pakistan.

Apparently Khan is being pressured to accept a deal through which he wouldn't reverse the legislation by the current government to make the investigation and prosecution of white collar crime legally impossible, and to make him agree to not try and initiate an independent foreign policy once again.

Imran Khan's high-stakes election gamble



Imran Khan: Shock and condemnation over attack on Pakistan ex-PM



An attack on Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan - which supporters say was an attempted assassination - has drawn international condemnation.
  

  
Mr Khan, 70, is recovering in hospital after being shot in the leg on Thursday at a protest march in Wazirabad, in the north-east of the country.
  

  
One person was killed and at least 10 injured in the attack on his convoy.
  

  
But Mr Khan is in a stable condition, his team say, and could potentially be discharged in the coming days.
  

  
The attack on Mr Khan has electrified the country, which the cricketer-turned-politician led until April, when he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no confidence.

Pak army requests govt to initiate legal action against Imran Khan



So just to summarize the weeks events, Imran Khan has the largest political party in Pakistan and is by the far the most popular figure. He has been effectively banned or censored on almost every news channel for months.

He started to stage a protest for new elections. On that protest an assassination attempt happened. 

His party puts out a press release, also banned from TV.

The assassin not banned on TV, professes to being a lone wolf including saying, "I killed him."

People on social media point out that's weird

He gets a 2nd spot on every TV channel, clarifying and reminding everyone he is a lone wolf.

Imran Khan himself makes a statement next day. Banned again. And names the ISI general involved.

Imran Khan raises Rs 5 billion for Pak flood victims through international telethon – ThePrint



Pakistanis donated half the amount that Khan usually collects to build and operate his free-treatment cancer hospitals over a whole year in two and a half hours to address the floods. 

As a Pakistani this level of public mobilization is moving.

Rs 5 billion is roughly $21M dollars coming from largely Pakistani diaspora from all around the world. 

The question to ask though, is Pakistan accounts for less than 1% of global climate emissions. 

Developed nations in 2009 pledged to have ~$100b for developing countries to fight climate change, yet ["most developed countries are not contributing their fair share toward meeting the $100 billion goal. Three major economies — the United States, Australia, and Canada — provided less than half their share of the financial effort in 2018"](https://www.wri.org/insights/developed-countries-contributions-climate-finance-goal#:~:text=In%202009%2C%20developed%20countries%20committed,and%20adapting%20to%20climate%20change.)

And it's not just a Trump thing, 

&gt;[the United States, despite being the largest historical emitter of carbon dioxide, has blocked such efforts at every turn. In Glasgow, **the Biden administration** joined a group of countries in resisting efforts to establish payments to developing countries that have been hit hard by climate change... .S. delegates fear that if a formal loss-and-damage fund is created, the United States could open itself up to litigation from poorer countries. **“We always remain thoughtful about the issue of liability,” John F. Kerry**, the U.S. international climate envoy, said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/08/29/pakistan-floods-climate-change/)

So just gotta ask is climate change gonna be a fight where it's a free for all, or an actual global fight like politicians say to voters?

Cause right now it looks like same old stuff

Imran Khan: Pakistan's Supreme Court rules arrest was illegal



Imran Khan has got it going on

All violence within protestors were done by the government by sending in their people in disguise as common people. There are clear evidence present in thousands of videos recorded where such people were being deployed by police and ranger's vehicles. Then they blame IK for inciting a violent riot. In reality, thousands of evidence is also available online specially on twitter how people were trying to stop such "agents" and prevent damage to property. Then the government and para military open fire using live bullets (not rubber bullets, real ammunition) and expired tear gas canisters. 

Meanwhile, 80% of the country is either out trying to peacefully protest and get IK back (specially since there were two failed assassination attempts on him by the government and military) because everyone fears the government will kill him or slow kill him (poison).

Many lives were lost but the situation is still not under control. Even though the CJP (idiot who ruled arrest (read abduction) was legal even though it was conducted within court premises) just ruled that arrest was not legal from pressure of the people of Pakistan. However, IK is still under the custody of the supreme court and kept in SC guest house to keep an eye on him. Mind you, IK has an active threat on him by the military and government.

Every Pakistani is waiting for elections so that we can get rid of this government and bring complete change that khan was already working on before he was ousted by the current imported government in assistance by foreign powers. He got us to +6.5% gdp growth and now we are at -7% gdp growth.

God help Pakistan. We the people want Imran Khan. 

You just have to walk the streets to know that the overwhelming majority want Imran Khan. The young generation will remember the crimes committed and gross human rights violation by the imported government, the senior military leadership, and the foreign powers.

Imran Khan ‘shot in leg in assassination attempt’ in Pakistan



He'll probably ride this publicity back into office.

Can anyone quickly surmise the political saga that has been Imran Khan and his departure?

November the month of the assassination attempt

If he dies, he becomes a martyr against the government. That's more terrifying for them then him alive, in power.

Several others injured and one man dead.

Reports of 3-4 bullets hitting Khan in the leg.

This will only make him stronger politically, the Establishment and PDM can rot in hell.

I’ll just copy-paste this here too:

Fuck the army and Pakistan’s slave owning political dynasties. 

It’s amazing how the west has given its blessing to a democratic coup run by the army and corrupt dynasties. 

Ever since they were put in power, you never even hear about half the shit they pull in western media outlets.

And now these billionaire politicians have resorted to assassination attempts on political rivals who want to prosecute them for corruption.

P.s: for those unaware, these supposedly rival dynasties have all joined together/bought politicians to form a minority government. The leaders of these parties have been in power for decades and own millions in assets abroad. They have also manipulated courts to terminate any corruption lawsuits against themselves. The west doesn’t report on any of it.

Wish him a speedy recovery. The guy is fearless, he fell down during a political really and broke his neck a few years ago, but came back a few weeks later.  Real champ

Well Most likley the Guy the caught was a Decoy and not the actual shooter, by what I've seen and what people are saying is, there must have been more than one shooter, these arsholes always have decoys, usually someone poor, usually for the sole purpose of getting caught in return for money to support family

i think this is a CON

and no i'm not a nutter

most days

look at the footage of him and his group on the top of the truckbus ...

there is about five to eight seconds of nothing, then a burst of auto gunfire is close by, no one is hit on the truckbus

the camera slowly and painfully pans down

mere seconds later some git hanging off the back of it suddenly fires a handgun at ... no one ... well maybe the guy in the gray top ducking for cover

THEN everyone panics and the camera person moves it a bit to create a "panic is on" sensation!

this is ALL for sympathy

Imran Khan lives with his dad and mom

I hope Imran about this, but right now the global political violence seems Khantagious

Pakistan regulator bans live telecast of Imran Khan’s speeches



Pakistani here.

Pakistan is under a fascist government, the military and the current federal government have resorted to kidnapping, illegal arrest and torture of those who speak out against the oppression. 

There's a massive information blackout throughout the country and almost every single newspaper and publication institute has been put under immense pressure to brand Imran khan and PTI(Imran khan's party) as traitors to the country. 

Our voices are suppressed, our freedom is taken away and the military is trying to suffocate all our liberty.  

The worst part is, we have no way to getting the word out to the world. The major news journals are pumping out pro military and pro federal bogus while any news channel, journalist or spokesperson who tries to speak the truth is immediately threatened, harassed, given death threats, kidnapped, tortured or silenced. 

Our COAS is too busy getting his retirement funds and homes prepared in the western countries while putting us all in slavery.  

I don't want to say we're doomed, but I'd be lying if things didn't look bad enough for us to consider every day a living hell.

Can't get in the way of the grifters in power.

These corrupt elite are trying their best to smother the voice of democracy. I hope he can publish through various Social Media platforms if they shut him down on TV

Internet suspended - social media restricted:

The internet service is down in some areas of pindi and isb. Live metrics show that Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are now restricted across Pakistan amid the arrest of former PM Imran Khan; the incident is likely to limit freedom of assembly and the public's ability to seek information.

Refrain from initiating any discussions under this pinned comment.

They are about to suspend internet services again?

More rumors that security forces will begin large-scale crackdown operations within the next 2 days, especially in Zaman Park

now there are rumors that the army let protesters into Lahore Corp commander's house in order to get him killed. This would get rid of a general who's seen as going against the grain and then they could blame PTI for the murder and label them terrorists.

Our hacker bois should hack all the tv news channels and play these footages there

Petition has been created for Asim Munir's resignation. Would be great if you all could sign. 

https://chng.it/j2DqDwtKk6

Any update as to 'shooting' heard outside HC last night? Any confirmation, denial, or explanation regarding that?

Not sure if this report is real or heresay but I heard all top generals, commanders and senior leadership of military along with their family has hightailed out of the country.. if there is any truth to this then there is a very strong chance that they expect something to happen that could compromise their and their families safety..

Any idea how long will they continue to censor social media?

Thanks for this post. Very well structured. Some links are dead though now: 

1) Video of Imran Khan's manhandling and siezure by paramilitary personnel

2) After math of the Ranger personnel's violent entry into the record room. Glass windows broken, equipment damaged/destroyed. Lawyers and staff beaten up

wtf immi chan said theyre not letting him go home despite of court granting him bail or sth, bro called for protests again 

smh retarded gov be like just let the man go 😭

He has been given bail, yet PDM first said roads weren't clear, then this shooting bull. He's basically under seige. They won't allow his personal security.

IK currently not able to leave IHC. Shooting reported near the court.

Zalmay Khalilzad: The Real masters have spoken


Someone new and politically neutral must step into this role. 
I call on General Munir to be a patriot and resign.

More Sheika quotes : 

No ban is possible, even if it does, we'll put a IK at the end of PTI and there we go.

Khan wasn't aware of the large amounts of arrests that took place of the leaders. Sheika: At the end of the day, Imran is what really matters. I spent 7 years in jail and there was a small news in the backpage of the newspaper i.e. no-one cares. That's life.

PTI is truly a party now. A large amount of members that became members for the first time, are now deep-rooted strong leaders. Easily the strongest party in the nation today.

Him shaking his fist doesn't mean that much. Calm down. Listen to what he said. Sheikha won't take the name of Asim Munir but IK said what he said. If you have the power, then run his words on air ...

30 days will be burhani... especially this 7 days. Eventually elections will come.

Asked if Elections will be accepted.. Popularity is what matters. Elections's acceptance isn't needed by other parties.

PDM was divided over Emergency. Seems like PPP is not interested, and wants to ensure that Bilawal is seen as PM.

Commented on the fact that Fauj is now here but Elections weren't able to be provided security? CJ will comment on Monday.

2500 have been arrested. Do not worry. They're losing their fears of arrests. They have lost their fear against the Army. Kids are walking around carrying sticks. Even their families cannot stop them.

Will Diesel shutdown Islamabad? Bruh, that's a joke :P apparenlty, there's lots of madrassa kids ... well, PTI workers are still out here. There will be collision and it will not be good. 

NSC ijlass was shut down. There was a large amount of transfers. Asim Munir is changing things massively behind the scenes. Sheikha really doesn't want to answer this.

Max the month will be incredibly difficult. Not more than that. 

PDM has all its wealth outside the nation, those living here are suffering due to these folks. Just pray that they can walk away. The people understand these issues, and they will take things in their hand if PDM cannot either fix these issues, or walk away.

Apparently Sheikha says : 

China came and told them to resolve the political tensions. Who knows if this is Sheikha behaviour or actual news.

Are protests stopping or still going on?

Anyone got a link to the iconic footage/image of the girl throwing her headscarf on the floor as she faces the army goons?

khan leaving court

apparently court gave immi chan a protective bail n they can’t arrest him now in *any case* until next Wednesday let’s go

W

Alhamdulilah it now appears alot of officers and soldiers refused to fire on protestors

We fought those corrupted generals in 1971. Now its your time. Never fear, Never surrender. I pray for you all to win this fight.
Love and support from bangladesh.

[Can't wait for this to be blamed on PTI too....](https://twitter.com/ShkhRasheed/status/1656922604429778945?t=BKzgWL_f6GBTa4-qDW55pQ&amp;s=19)

There’s rumors that Lahore corp commander is getting sacked for refusing to open fire on protesters. Commandant of FC KPK was also sacked.

I say ALHUMDULILLAH that we got to know what the army actually is and that "watan k muhafiz" wala manjan that they're giving us for the past 70 years, its now or never we go in millions we take what is ours. THIS COUNTRY

Hey guys. Sorry if this is a stupid question but I really have to know. Why did the Army arrest Imran and not the police?

Is this the real Jail Baro Tareek?

What is happening to IK is clear cut political victimization but do PTI supporters even realize their hypocrisy?

You all used to sing praises of this same army until 18 months ago. You used to make fun of the politicians/journalists/bloggers they would kidnap and assault because their actions favored you then. 

You never criticized IK for giving up so much space to army in his tenure and the same fascist techniques that were deployed by the army under his tenure.

Most social media access is still blocked in Pakistan. So I'm a little bit apprehensive of what the 'government' plans to do tomorrow.

Any hanky panky on their part might unleash a wave of violence magnitudes worse than what was witnessed recently.

🔴 The President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi met with the Former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan.   
Matters of state concern were discussed.

Would I be wrong to think that the financial damage caused by the shut down of internet might be greater than the property damage caused by the protestors?

Rakhi Sawant rocked, lumber 1 shocked

PTI  seems confident that Imran Khan would be able to secure bail from Islamabad Highcourt tomorrow. Their social media team has announced that Imran Khan would address the nation after getting bail

While we still don't know how it all will end, shout out to Talha Anjum, Quratulain Baloch and Hasan Raheem to be one of the few celebrities to actually show any support for the protestors. Talha, especially, has not held back anything

Are PTI supporters not going to come out to protest against the unlawful detainment of PTI leaders and their families, or was this just about Imran Khan?

The fascist army and their gang of criminal PDM thugs will pay for the crimes against Pakistan and people. 

I feel sick i supported these traitors most of my life, never again. They sold out Kashmiri's for cheap, traitors the lot of them!

Nonetheless, the crying by PDM is so fun to watch.

Listening the new leaked audio. Mohsin Kayani will apparently give bail to Imran Khan tomorrow.. Alright. Interesting.

Lets see what happens tomorrow. What was the point of this arrest then?

Is email blocked as well??? What ISN'T blocked?

pdm leaders crying on tv really makes my dil khush

Another thing that's very clear...

Regardless of government behaviour.. People power still remains Supreme.. He was dragged by his collar, and brought back in a bullet proof Mercedes.. All because of what the people did.

[Seeing Kamran Khan beg IK to remove the boys from his narrative wasn't what I expected as an outcome of all this but here we are...](https://twitter.com/AajKamranKhan/status/1656664511275995137?t=Dop-KFwhVNXM2KKiyJt_RQ&amp;s=19)

If the army got in power is it true that no one can enter or leave Pakistan for a few years?

so are they going to lift ban on mobile networks and social media

In general ... it's pretty clear that establishment realised a few things 

1. Imran Khan is easily the most popular politican this nation has ever seen.

2. Even the Establishment itself, on the inside, has far too much support for Imran. The noises of actual mutiny is what stopped this. 

This is just to see if they can get Imran to reduce some of the insanity that's happening.

Watch and see if there's a bunch of transfers/dismissals in the higher ecehlons of army after this.

[FFS ANDREW TATE LEAVE IMMI CHAN ALONE 💀](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/985814903807946803/1106212106983972944/Screenshot_2023-05-11_at_18.31.45.png?width=1678&amp;height=656)

I wouldn't be so optimistic about SC's decision yet. There are still a lot of things that can go wrong. The case has been referred back to IHC and the court could very well refuse to grant IK bail. They could just arrest him again after he leaves the court this time.

On one side, one of the judges say IK wasn't provided justice and on the other side they're telling him to go back to the same court that failed to provide him justice.... This some high level IQ

Any legal experts here know if the case will still stand or is it just the arrest that was unlawful? Who's to say he won't be arrested next week?

IK still told to contact IHC for bail...... Seems like they're gonna keep the chance to have him arrested in future again. For me, this arrest was the boys testing the waters to see how much support IK has and now that they know, they're just dispersing the crowds through IK. Also the way he was manhandled on his arrest and how he was treated according to IK himself after his arrest, him arriving in a black bulletproof Mercedes looking all fresh and wearing sunglasses seems a bit sus ngl....

What a gangster

cj took immi chan's arrest back n said his arrest was illegal lets goooo

SUPREME COURT DECLARES IMRAN KHAN ARREST GHAIR QANOONI

Some conspiracies going around that IK has made a deal?

Gand phattiwi hai, supreme court can end this. If not, it's make it or break it tomorrow after Friday prayers.

[LoL. Guy's on a whole another level of being delusional ](https://twitter.com/siasatpk/status/1656615138269745152?t=YNo2_I5hZwufNtDmcCO1xQ&amp;s=19)

As far as I am concerned, all of this is the fault of the supreme Court. 

PDM and the army generals are doing everything to keep the power with themselves as expected. 

However the sc has no power to fight for. 

They opened the courts at midnight to dismiss ik and refused to even acknowledge the letter at the time of. 

Then, the entire year ik has been facing cases upon cases with no merit - and the sc doesn't stop the witch hunt? SC also doesn't force the police to accept the FIRs from ik after being shot.

Then the sc keeps on delaying the 90 days for the elections, giving PDM more and more leeway - which isn't allowed in the constitution. 

Finally, ik was forced to come to the courts in person when there is precedence to do this online and while his shooter was allowed to answer his case online even though Ik was medically unfit and there have been threats on his life.

Imran Khan’s arrest is completely unlawful, Supreme Court.

Present Khan by 4:30, Chief Justice

HOLY $H!T, ACTUAL GOOD NEWS FROM SC.

it seems IK's arrest may be termed unlawful! this will only make the protests more justified.

Imran Khan and his team attacked by Rangers.

Lawyer and security personnel were left bloodied and IK dragged from wheelchair and taken away.

Holy shit so they kidnapped him? Wtf man.

GHQ pe protest kro, judiciary better step up

Not to be that guy ... But yeah is there no first aid in that place ?

Yeh jo dehshatgardi hai , iss ke peechay wardi ha

Disgraceful

That’s really sad what did why beating him?

this is democracy? more like dictatorship

u/savevideobot

Need more context though. Was this guy physically resisting IK's arrest?

Hilarious use of ketchup.

Is Imran Khan genuinely the best option right now?

I live abroad, and have gotten to know a few Pakistanis here. The views I've gotten on Imran Khan are all over the place from strongly positive to very negative. 

I don't have much context, and I know the political situation is complicated to say the least. 

But I'd like to understand more. Has he done good for the country? Will his leadership help Pakistan? Is there some other person or party who would be better suited?

What is the truth about him and what is just rumours?

I see him as the best option out of the rest sure there are still going to be problems but at this point anyone is better than the nawazs.

The truth is that for 75+ years the Army, politiacians, industrialists and judges of Pakistan have raped and looted the economy again and again,

Imran Khan is the one leader that has no concrete corruption charges on him, has opened unis and hospitals to help ppl even when he wasnt in power and is just a good man fighting for the survival of his country and the welfare of his countrymen and women. 

Rest is up to the reader as the reality is front of the world, its black and white, i.e., good vs evil. Merit based appointments and rule of law VS law of the jungle and Corruption. 

It's a no brainer for anyone with 2 brain cells to understand where the future and survival of Pakistan lies...

Short answer YES, long answer YES

Jokes apart, look at the current coalition where 14 parties clubbed together to compete against PTI, pakistan is nothing short of Mussolinis fascist Italy in any term today

Yes, he is. Simply compare Imran Khan's priorities with that of PDM and you will find your answer.

Imran Khan has brought a political movement in Pakistan on an ideology that has developed over 30 years. 65% of Pakistanis are younger than 35, so majority of the country grew up believing in his message of a "Naya Pakistan" (new Pakistan). Khan himself has gone through an inner revolution as a personality, but his core ideals remained steady. He stands for justice, welfare, and meritocracy. 

After 25 years of politics, Khan finally became PM of Pakistan in 2018. He inherited a virtually bankrupt country, as a result of extremely stupid policymaking we are being reminded of today as the same people are ruling and have driven the economy 6 feet under (no exaggeration). 

As PM, Khan had welfare, stabilisation, reform, and accountability on his mind. As with all leaders, his policies were hit and a miss. No black and white answer. 

Khan largely failed in his accountability narrative, as there was clear interference from the country's junta (judges missing hearings, benches being switched, and all that sweet jazz), although the National Accountability Bureau [did see the most financial recoveries](https://www.dawn.com/news/1692263) under PTI. On reforms, it was a mixed bag. He was able to bring decent reforms in the banking, government services, ease of doing business/startups, bureaucratic digitisation, foreclosure laws, anti-harassment laws, agriculture and healthcare. However, he was not able to fully reform judicial procedures (although towards the end of his tenure he introduced [700+ reforms to the outdated criminal justice system](https://www.globalvillagespace.com/pti-govt-makes-over-700-amendments-in-criminal-justice-system/) that never saw the light of day) and also failed to reform the public sector enterprises (although Pakistan Post saw a mini golden era).

Khan's main victories were on the welfare and stabilisation fronts. On welfare, Khan created the Ministry on Poverty Alleviation and introduced the *Ehsaas* (Urdu for "Conscious empathy") program that was an absolutely revolutionary idea in a society where the bottom 30% is treated like cattle. Stanford acknowledged it as a [framework for "Developmental Welfare State"](https://fsi.stanford.edu/publication/frameworks-developmental-welfare-state-lessons-pakistans-ehsaas-programme). Watch this [documentary](https://www.ehsaas2047.com/documentaries) on mission Ehsaas 2047 (to have welfare for those who need it by the country's 100 anniversary) to know more about it, but basically its a program that includes universal micro health insurance, micro loans for micro businesses, cheap housing, and so on . On stabilisation, Khan's macro policy had lead to a virtual turn around in all key macro-indicators, with Pakistan seeing sustainable growth for the first time in decades. [Even the IMF acknowledged this](https://www.dawn.com/news/1637369). Mind you this was during COVID and then Ukraine war right after. Khan's rivals tried to downplay this achievement massively through some insane propaganda during his time. Today, when the economy is a dumpster fire and fascism is growing to extreme heights, this lot of people are nowhere to be seen. However, Khan was not able to control the microeconomic situation, with inflation spiralling (nothing like today, but still) and wages not keeping up.

I am sure others will add their take, but this is how I would (very) briefly summarise Imran Khan. There's a whole different aspect to this as to how he broke a (purposefully kept) broken system and has become a king chosen by the people since Pakistan has absolutely no one else left sincere to her orphaned poor people. But that's a whole different conversation.

Yes right now he is. Don’t get me wrong he has mistakes as well but anyone who thinks that he isn’t the best option right now just needs to look at what’s been happening these past 11 months. Tbh it’s not even that he’s the “best” option, he’s the only legitimate option that has any hope or chance of doing something good for Pakistan

I'm sorry, but you have room temperature IQ if you think that Immi chan can be compared to the likes of Showbaz Sharif or Bilawal Rani.

Plugging in a brief account of Events I wrote a while ago, you can also verify all this from various news sources.

Tldr: Yes! He's the best option we've got.

It's a REALLLY long story that starts in Apr 2022 but I'll try to summarize it.

1. Imran Khan gets ousted as PM in Apr 2022 in a no-confidence vote (Opposition parties bribed IK's candidates to vote against him with the help of the then army chief).
2. IK's decides to go in public and asks for early elections, he does massive jalsas in almost every big city of Pakistan.
3. He announces his first long march in May 2022 but state unleashes unprecedented brutality on his supporters on 25th May.
4. Due to the constant attacks of state force against PTI (IK's party) IK decides to call off the long march.
5. In Nov 2022 IK does another long march, this time there is an assassination attempt on him, which he thankfully survives.
6. IK names State minister of interior, An Army officer and the current PM Shehbaz Sharif for the murder attempt but still he isn't able to get an FIR registered against them despite his Govt being in Punjab.
7. IK decides to dissolve the KP and Punjab assemblies to force a general elections, firstly the army threatens IK's candidates to jump ship but IK is finally able to dissolve those assemblies.
8. After that the Election commission colludes with the Army and the current Govt to not  conduct an election within 90 days (Although Constitution of Pakistan strictly says  that elections ***MUST BE CONDUCTED WITHIN 90 DAYS AFTER ASSEMBLIES ARE DISSOLVED.***
9. IK's party go to the supreme court and get the decision in their favour, SC instructs ECP to conduct elections in 90 days.
10. Now ECP, Army and Govt hands are tied, they don't want an elections because according to all surveys Khan is gonna sweep the elections due to his unmatched popularity.
11. The Govt and Army decide to strangle IK in fake cases of blasphemy, murder and terrorism (As of now he is named in 84 different FIRs).
12. IK is currently living in Zaman Park, Lahore recovering from his assassination attempt injuries.
13. The Govt tries to arrest IK in one of the fake cases but his supporters are adamant that IK must not surrender himself due to Pakistani state's brutal history of murdering popular leaders (Zulfiqar Ali bhutto etc.)
14. The police and Rangers siege IK's house to  arrest him but his supporters put up a fight against Police baton charge, rubber bullets, and tear gas for more than 24 hours.
15. IK's legal team gets a stay from Lahore High Court to stop the Police operation at his house till 10AM 16 March 2023.
16. So far his supporters have been able to successfully repel police forces from arresting him.
17. IK has promised to appear in Court (which previously he didn't because of the security threats to his life).

This is a very brief summary of the developments that have happened in the past 1 year, and I may have missed some events but this is kinda the gist.

The Pakistan Army is currently very unpopular in the masses due to their support of the current Govt which mostly comprises of corrupt and compromised politicians.

Absolutely. 

Literally no other option.

People here will give you different opinions (based on judging him against a **SCALE** they wont even judge themselves with or other corrupt politicians with) but No one can say that he is corrupt like all other politicians. People who hate him just do cause they benefit from current corrupt system he is trying to change.  and Change doesn't happen over night.

Yep he is the best option. Just look at the others.

Pakistanis are not very smart when it comes to governments don't listen to their shitty takes. They have not been able to create stable government so they are not qualified to give their 2 cents on shit. Hate hearing boomers talk politics when they're the ones who let it get to this.

Technically I am the best option. Otherwise IK for sure

All the rest are in power at the moment that includes all the other political parties and the establishment so he is the only option left. His government had problems but I feel many of those problems were problems created for him by Bajwa/establishment by stealing the seats from his party so his government was hobbled. If he comes to power again unless there is mass rigging again he will be able to implement a lot of the stuff he promised.

I am a liberal atheist so disagree with IK on many issues but at the same time I understand and agree with him that most of Pakistan's issues will be solved with a good justice system. As that will result in more efficient merit based economy with few people needing to cheat, steal and use corrupt practices to feed their families. Then only will we have the time to fight for social issues.

Nah I’m the best option, vote me for prime minister

In practice, PPP, PMLN and PTI governments have hardly been too different. Each failed to break the bailout cycles, instead taking steps to reinforce the next crisis for short term political expedience. All of them have also been prevented from governing either till full term, or in the full capacity. PTI benefited from nearly unfettered establishment support, the last remnants of which are currently seen in the SC benches.

The range you describe is the result of heavy political polarisation. It’s not just about political disagreements and power play. People have been convinced that PDM vs PTI is a good and evil match up. It’s bitter, personal, and the ground for it has been prepared for decades. I hold IK more responsible for it, as he’s essentially benefited from it and built an entire political narrative around it.

This is a Kham shilling sub, so you'll pretty much hear the same thing over and over again.

This is not the sub reddit to ask this question in, this is literally a PTI echo chamber, you’ll only hear good about Imran Khan here.

Idgaf about PTI honestly. But I respect that they started a trend of criticising you know who. They also forced the youth to get involved in the shitstorm so.

He is an awful choice but the best option among others.

Emotionally: Yes, Realistically: He is worse.

Nope. All are bad. Unless it’s a completely grassroots situation. Pti is okay but that’s like asking do you want solid stool or the runny poos. They’re both still shit

Hell No, Imran Khan is no where near the best option for Pakistan, just look at his demands he doesn't want establishment to be neutral, he wants them to support him. He just wants government either by hook or cook. Can't you see what he did with the economy when it was certain that he will be ousted by giving petrol subsides. He isn't fighting for civil supremacy he is fighting for Imran supermacy.

I'm not saying that you should vote for pdm, The Best option for Pakistan is left wing parties who actually care for the general public like Mazdor Kisan party but unfortunately, they are not that common among general public.

He is shit

The best option is Siraj Ul Haq of Jamat e Islami. No corruption cases on him and no playboy scene.

Is this a serious question?

Article 140A of the Constitution of Pakistan deals with the devolution of political, administrative, and financial responsibilities to the local government. While this article does not directly address your question about Imran Khan's suitability as a leader, it does emphasize the importance of decentralization and empowering local governance structures in Pakistan.

Regarding your question about Imran Khan's leadership, it is important to note that opinions on his performance as the Prime Minister of Pakistan are divided. Some believe that he has taken positive steps towards addressing corruption and improving economic stability, while others criticize his handling of foreign relations and his failure to fulfill some of his campaign promises.

Ultimately, whether Imran Khan is the best option for Pakistan at this time is a matter of personal opinion. It is essential to gather information from multiple sources to form a well-informed perspective on his leadership and policies. Additionally, it is important to remember that political situations are often complex, and there may not be a single person or party who is best suited for all of Pakistan's needs.

In terms of separating truth from rumors, it is advisable to rely on credible sources of information and fact-checking before forming an opinion on any issue.

Pakistan has only bad options. Imran Khan is by a long margin the least bad, and so I support him and pray for his success.

dont know why you care: if you are not a Pakistani.

anything is better than daranomics

Yes

Yes. The only thing I expected to be better from PDM was that they would bend over to america as they always do and use the funding to bring prices down .

Instead they skyrocketed them so the ONE thing they were collectively good for is non existent to phir what exactly are these clowns here to accomplish?

Imran khan might be but PTI isn’t.

He’s the only option 😭

Almost anyone that opposes PTI right now is most likely coming from a well off background or even directly profiting off of the corruption that PTI is sure to cut off once they come into power. There are a ton of PDM trolls in this subreddit that will attempt to make you think IK is just like everyone else. He isn't. Just look up articles on how much proven corruption the others have done vs what IK has done. He is the only logical choice right now and anyone that says otherwise is willfully ignorant or malicious

yes yes yes and yes

Obviously, yes.

Dekho dekho kon aya!  Khan, tum sub ka Baaap.

Best option is to join back with India or to hire a competent leader.

He is a "better" option for Pakistan considering how his opponents are damaging for the country.

Only time can tell if he is proven to be the "best" option.

Our analysts are not understanding that it is not IK vs others... Rather it is status quo vs. change.

People in Pakistan are fed up with the status quo and he is the biggest voice against it. If he compromises in future, people will look somewhere else.

I will vote for anyone who will put much much higher taxes on real estate at-least 1 % every year and kills the blood sucking leech that is starving our economy. If you don’t pay your taxes you should have your land taken away from you. Time to destroy the military real estate industrial complex.

Best among the worst. If he continues to pursue his vengeance powered politics and keep on making prosperity of people his 2nd priority. And if his best choices are the likes of buzdar than he is no better than others.

He's the best option because it's really hard to convince many people to stand up against political families. 
Is he the best person to get us out of the mess? Maybe not. He had a chance, and honestly, he did a better job, but still, it was more talk than anything. 

I have now given up altogether. The fact of the matter is that people are dying for them.

No bro. There is no good option.

Khan or die kind of situation at the moment tbh.

The only option. DHA walo ko, never!

A country of 220 million people and just these few options? 

The options have been created by the Army. We need to allow better people in politics

GHQ openly siding against Imran Khan



They really opened their thesaurus for this one.

That's the whole point of an FIR you fools.

You nominate someone who you believe is behind something, and then evidence and allegations are brought forth after the investigation. That's why it's called an investigation.

You guys are blocking the registration of the FIR, then how can you say his claims are baseless?

why isnt the same ISPR coming with press releases when Maryam and PDM openly name and shame bajwa and all the military? IK wasn't even able to get an FIR registered, army aint no holy cow. What more evidence do you need? isnt it enough the army didn't allow this generals name to be mentioned in the FIR ffs?

Is this the first time they have made this kind of statement because this doesn't seem like news worthy

What recourse to legal avenues when he can’t even file an FIR that he wants….

When is ISPR releasing the song against IK?

Lol dgispr handle is dead now.

Ghaddaron Ka Headquarters!

mulk barbaad kr k bhi sharam nhi ati in logon ko

Who needs enemies when you have an army this haramkhor.

Porn army seems afraid.

Im sure chatGPT wrote this.

Did they use ChatGpt to write this?

they are scared to post  this on their twitter account lol

batti bna kr apni G me lele GHQ

Soldiers and civilians are dying everyday on border and KPK and they only care about statements from a political leader. Priorities

PTI SUPPORTERS : "We just need the elections to happen. We will win a large majority and then Pakistan is going to be magically changed forever"

ARMY: "GO FUC YOURSELVES"

  


Now ask yourselves how are the Army ever going to let PTI implement their agenda? It cant be clearer than that.

  


Without an actual confrontation between tbe people and the Army, there is no hope.

  


A nation doomed to sink like the Titanic, with the Army recklessly in charge on the bridge, with politicians fighting on the top deck for room in the life boats, whilst the Awam is all stuck below decks waiting for the water to engulf them.

Pork Army didn’t release anything whenever PMLN would say stuff LOLL

These are the people who brought him why can't they side against him

To bhai wo inko dushman bana raha hai or ye us ki baaton ko deny bhi na karein??Are you ok in the head?

It seem IK clearly flustered that 
1. He could not appoint next CoAS and lost gov.
1. Then he wanted election soon so he can still appoint next CoAS. He failed and next CoAS was appointed by SS.
1. Then he felt court on his side so he broke Punjab and KPK assembly hopping he will get election and CJ will help deal with CoAS if get 3/4 majority. Still no election.
1. Now he likely loose CJ in September and thus SC will fell to other side as well and so now he need election before September. Which isn’t seem to be happening.

CJ seem to have differed all three cases without setting time for next hearing thus adding to IK frustration where it seem CJ has also put his hands up. 

IK last resort is to go back on attack so he might influence establishment but he got written answer form ISPR making it clear he is not going to be entertained. This all has nothing to do with attack on IK but rather establishment eroding support of PTI and on to they do not even like him to come to power in any form at least during Asim Muneer tenure. And after that IK/PTI will be not relevant after three four years. It will be just another party.

Ok so why can't Imran Khan take the evidence to the court. Courts should bring Gen to come and give his evidence and than let's see.

Yeah kick his butts .. IK is always lying and have no proof .. remember what he said "mughe jo koi kuch bhi bolta hai wo mein maan leta ho "

Well they’re right. Where’s the evidence? How many times has he said “100% proof” then not shown it in court or to anyone else?

Yeah, go wash yourself.

Farcical country.

oooo shiver me timbers

Journalist Imran Riaz Khan is currently being tortured terribly, he is in critical condition. [Copied]



God bless him and protect him….

I’m really worried about him. Court asked for him to be produced yesterday but he wasn’t. Court should pressurised the police more. 

However him being tortured seems to be speculation / rumour for now. Haven’t seen any concrete source yet.

4 millions subscribers on Youtube and each of his video getting a million views. Thats tremendous reach and influence. I doubt that they will dare to murder him in the custody. But they wont shy from doing to him what they did with Shehbaz Gill and Azam Swati.

As Putin says, dead person doesn’t talk. His journalism is more dangerous then people’s anger if he gets killed. If kept alive he will keep being a trouble for years to come and if he dies then after few weeks people will calm down but long term trouble will be over. That’s their Benefit/cost analysis.

Is this the end of PTI and Imran Khan? :(

I have always supported Imran Khan and his party because I genuinely believe that he is sincere to the country. It was very sad for me when he was sent home last year but now he was very popular and I was hoping that he will get the office again. However things have changed dramatically after May 9.

Today Dr Shireen Mizari and other prominent leaders left PTI. Twitter is full of rumors that Shah Mahmood and Asad Umar are also going to leave. Now the situation seems very hopeless.

I think the upcoming elections were the best chance for Imran Khan. Now he is getting old and his party has been broken into pieces, I dont think his party will be able to revive again.

What you all think, is this the end of PTI? Please tell me there's still some hope :(

Most probably IK and PTI are out of the political picture. It is possible that only IK is removed as per **minus-one formula** and the Elahis pick up the leftovers of PTI and rebrand it. 

We gotta remember that IK’s demand for elections is totally a legal one. But we have the worst history if we consider fairness of elections. 

**Many analysts say that Pakistan had only one fair election since its independence.** We all know what happened then. Bangladesh was born. Even if other leaders resign from PTI and only IK remains with a few insignificant candidates for MNAs, the **Boiz will never let PTI get fair elections**. So with or without elections, it is mostly curtains on the chapter of IK and PTI.

Imran Khan has unprecedented support from the Pakistani diaspora in the west. Even 4th and 5th generation western Pakistanis suddenly started to take interest in Pakistan.

This group is well educated and financially strong, they could have invested a lot of money (and time) in Pakistan, if they believed there was rule of law in the country.

But to them the truth about the army is clear now, and the pure hatred for the army is actually a game changer. Next time the army effs around in one of their misadventures, the diaspora will rather call them out than support them. 

The world is more globalized than ever. Your reputation matters more than ever. Pr wise, on global level, the army has committed suicide.


&gt;Please tell me there's still some hope :(

Well IK probably won't give up. Of course, I still maintain that Pakistanis doesn't deserve him, and he could have lived in England with his sons, but life is funny this way. The one in England living with his son will be the ruler.

If anything, this is making PTI immortal in the hearts of Pakistanis.

Ideologies dont die that easy. Sure alot of people left. But as long as khan is here , they are in the game.

Nope, parties/leaders who have 70%+ public support don't die. But destroy anyone who tries to destroy them. No matter who it is. Hearts and mind matter then anything else.

Think about it this way…if this is the end, it took a whole fucking army and every single political party and full state machinery to take one man down. What a man.

There will never be another one like him

A lot of the common people will be voting for the bat, not the electables. There was a great infographic a few days back which showed a lot of PPP and PMLN kept switching sides from the 90s and then ended up in PTI. They are leaving now which will allow the youth to come through. If IK can hold fort and we go into elections, proper revolution can take place with the youth holding office and taking Pakistan to the next era. The public support is too much for PTI.

End of PTI? most probably. The plane that flew around getting everyone onboard PTI is back at work and the establishment has the pawns and puppets to play around with.

However, it is not the end for Imran Khan. Perhaps a beginning - one that he must've had years ago.

Imran Khan is a warrior. He will not go down without a fight. That's for sure.

IK is not just a political party which will die, he is an ideology which will live .Most of us will continue to play our part within our capacity.

It's the begining. Just wait and watch. Pak establishment is yet to have its toughest time

I think it turned out for the good. I lost all hope in this country a few weeks ago i think it more than enough imran khan could have done for us. I wish him good health with all my heart he should just now calm down and lay low and silent and live out his days in peace in some peaceful place and enjoy and relax with his family. He is the QUAID of this country he is the leader he is the awakener of this nation, i don’t want to watch him die for this pathetic excuse of a country ruled by corrupt maniacs. 

Live long in peace IK.
May Allah bless/reward you for your effort/jihad. 

Will try to leave this country for good but i just love the land so much 💔.

Not sure what happens to PTI.. but one thing is for sure.

My vote will always be ready for Imran khan. The man has earned it with his sheer determination &amp; hardwork.

He has dedicated his life for this country, the least he deserves is my VOTE.

These things does not affect PTI much. PTI was always a one man party. Short of killing IK or IK going abroad, PTI will not end.

There’s one reason he won’t come back. The people are cowards. Bengalis whupped the army, the Turks dealt with their army in about 8 hours. Sri Lanka didn’t give a F and here we are. A year on still too fucking scared to come out and take our country back.

no, this is the beginning of end of army

Agar PTI khamba bhee laga dein tho bhee jeetain gay. Imran Khan is PTI and the only way they'll win is by rigging. Those who leave can be replaced, hopefully with younger people ready to fight the good fight.

No. There is no end now. Too bad for PDM, military, and the clown PDM supporters.

Main kala kafian!

People seem to forget that the vote was for IK not electables. He is still here he will get even more votes. So yes it might be a slight setback but in the long run he will come back.

Weak awam sitting at home watching all this instead of being out in large numbers.

As Zardari used to say ye sab 3-3 saal k liye aatay hain, hum humesha k liye. Hopefully not. Lotas and quitters exist in all parties. It never really harmed them

Doesn't matter. You vote for who you believe in. Doesn't matter who wins, what matters is for you to do the right thing

Imran khan should leave the country and start a media empire. he could learn from likes of Murdoch. being a PM isn’t the only way to bring a change Or have influence. There would be so many OSPs to donate to his international Tv channel. He raised upward of 20 crore for victims of Punjabi police brutality in few days.

Now you will see new young faces, asal youth ab niklay gain, those who never had anything to lose to begin with, we just saw that you will loose if you go against the grain in this current system, so why not take one down with you.

The current situation is actually the rise of the most powerful democratic party in the history of Pakistan with Imran Khan and later the iconic Murad Saeed leading Pakistan to become the most powerful country in Asia. The current government and its masters operating in the shadows are losing phenomenally. No dictatorial government can function without public support. And the public is with Imran Khan.

&amp;#x200B;

THE ALL POWERFUL, THE ONE ABOVE ALL has an amazing and perfect plan. What I see is that the old political people are going to leave PTI and the strong young and dynamic leadership will emerge from within the younger generation triggering the most powerful democratic setup that will be honest, to begin with. 

Rest assured; this comes from a neutral person with no interest in politics or anything remotely associated with politics. Economic default is coming along with severe hardships. Once that is over InshaAllah, Pakistan's rise will dwarf its neighboring countries.

I think this is the end of the road for IK to be the PM of Pakistan . The show was great while it lasted, but at last, the puppeteers pulled down the curtain. IK may have created a legacy and philosophy , but in pakistan, the final verdict is by the military establishment . Now, it is clear to us all that even with funding , public support, partial support within military establishment , and a great narrative, you can't get power in pakistan. 
IK should open a media channel , earn some big bucks , and even a big worldwide fanbase .

People decide not government at the end of the day

Supported PTI for Imran Khan and I will continue to do so. The other leaders are still human and subject to pressure so I don't blame all of them. I still feel honesty and truth will prevail by the grace of Allah. 

Many factors are different this time around. OSPs are galvanized like never before, people in Pakistan are much better informed due to social media, and the army committed PR seppuku with their stupid antics. 

PTI may not survive, but its message will. Either Pakistan will be chopped up and divided by it's creditors once PDM fails to pay back it's loans, or we will come back after hanging all the corrupt PDM goons.

There is this old saying “oft evil will shall evil mar” which basically means that evil through its very own nature will undo itself

Khan simply needs to wait and watch. They will go to extreme lengths to vilify him but the very same instruments are going to turn against them and they will have nobody to blame but themselves 

It’s a tale as old as time. Just wait and see

No, I heard its just big boys taking back control of the party they launched ane funded. All these parties mqm, qaaf, pti are creation of big boys. Rumors that he will come back in 1 month. Idk how true.

Not really. It's all about how he handles himself or risks becoming Altaf bhai lol.

I think so 😄

Not sure why they expect him to carry the whole burden when they refuse to stand with him in tough times.

Let me tell you this. PTI is afloat and strong as long as Imran Khan is its leader. Even if his most closest aids stay with him. PTI will remain very popular or even get more popular but once or if he leaves politics/PTI then its game over. PTI has always been Imran Khan.

End of PTI probably the beginning I would say..

Well on the other hand just see how hopeless and desperate they are to take down one single person what a legend and what a shame.

I have no doubt that judiciary has never been on IK side, or they could have stop all that way before 9 April.
They probably tried to finish the story when IK was arrested but response was overwhelmed so they had to move to plan B.

I'm in constant depression &amp; heart sinking, unable to sleep.
My family in Pakistan even doesn't want to talk politics over phone.
Can only pray nothing else

IK has done what a lot of intellectuals, politicians and journalists could not do. A dream of a new Pakistan, a hope of a better Pakistan where a common man is respected. People believe in this dream and they have rejected the corrupt lot of this system. With or without Khan we have moved into a new era. If  I have learned one thing from Imran Khan is that you should never ever lose hope and submit to no one else other than Allah. Insha Allah the dark days will be over soon.

Has pti taken some damage? Yes. Is it over for imran khan? No

Everyone who is leaving is free to do so. In the end they have revealed their faces. They were snakes, I never liked them in the first place, they all seemed like a bunch of leeches. I support Imran Khan, because he is the only one who has shown real care for his own people. Out of all of them. So it's a good thing they're leaving, it's a cleansing. We have 220mio people and we worry about a few hype riders leaving? I'm certain we have many people more competent then those who left. I support PTI because of Imran Khan, not because of Shireen Mazari

I am afraid it looks like an end but i also feel this is a new beginning. If that makes sense?

may be the PTI but def not imran khan.

PTI had too many "electables". They were just opportunists waiting to jump ship. They aren't used to pressure or "revolution" as people here call it. It's a blessing in disguise that it can go back to its roots and collect new people rather than certified corrupts.

I hope not.

I don't like PTI and won't vote for them. But they really are popular and deserve a full tenure. This is heartbreaking. I hope something good comes along and they can bounce back to have a fair election and an establishment-free tenure.

Political end, yes. The man is looking at life behind bars for his remaining life unless he wants to go live in exile with his kids back in England

Brother, this is the start......

Of his chitrol!!!!!!!!

I voted twice for IK, I Genuinely thought he could bring the change but he fell prey to Misinformation and hyped up numbers of "Khushamdi" people around him. Made some mistakes and dug his own political grave eventually. 

You're right, idk who even to vote for if the elections happen as all the parties are equally corrupt and messed up. If there will be any version of PTI left, it will be broken and cancerous too.

After reading alot of comments here, I have concluded that most of the people commenting here have zero understanding of political history of Pakistan. 
This is same playbook which was used against PPP/ PMLN/ MQM. You were happy about it.
IK is actually responsible for increasing role of Army in politics post 2017/18 through same page.

Imran Khan compromised on many things for power and that was his biggest mistake, instead of engaging with political rivals and creating a running system he completely cornered them. His narratives keep changing from fighting corruption then fighting america enslaving us then military generals at last. He didn't have a clear vision. Sorry to say but I don't see any recovery from this. Khan could have done so much by channelizing this support he had but he chose to inject Venum into them and indulge them in dirty politics of rival parties. He sold his soul to the devil for power and the devil banished him when he stopped worshiping him.

Those who made him. Destroyed him. What happens if you come in power on the back of king makers vs real struggle.

Where is Shah Mehmood Qureshi going? I thought he was basically the number 2 in PTI?

When did Pakistan had hope since independence, Pakistan has no future even Bangladesh is doing better then Pakistan

Probably, yes

No way. They left … That’s sad to hear

It’s only the beginning. Khan will bounce back. PTI will only become stronger.

Khan has done his work, lazy asses won’t come to streets for a peaceful march, what else can he do?? People need to start marching towards Islamabad, peacefully, and just sit in front of parliament. People have to come out in millions and not just 10-20k…only then something can happen but we lazy asses just wanna be warriors on Twitter.

When I think of Pakistan minus Imran Khan, I cannot think of anything other than disappointment. Once IK is out of the picture, there really isn’t anything and anyone for Pakistan, its just darkness for as far as we can see.

It just means getting rid if the khaki gangsters won't happen peacefully or via democracy. When you remove peaceful means, only tragedy follows. There will be violence.

It's not over, and it never will be over..

people leaving like this will surely weaken pti but it's not like they would win on their own , with the amount of popularity khan has rn a normal worker can win with a ticket

It's also the end for the respect the People had for the army, he's taking the army down with him

The night is always darkest before dawn

Big no

Pti is not a party which is made with joint big names
Imran Khan is PTI and PTI is Imran khan
Han bry name jany sy thora frq zror prta ha but Imran khan popularity ki jis peak py hain abi to itna frq ni prta...probably koi b is time PTI ki ticket py lry usmy jetna he ha...or hr halky ma ticket leny waly b10 10 log mojod to koi tension ni

I don't really suppory IK but he did a great job exposing the real culprits. Hats off to khan. 

I have been against the army/establishment ruling our country for as long as i remember. But imagine saying this in 2015. Black vigo ka dar rehta tha.

Insha’Allah

I think it's too early to judge. IK fate maybe resting on if Srilanka like unrest happens due to default.

No this is the End of Our Pakistan

DHA giveth, DHA taketh away 

This was bound to happen. The DHA CEOs have dirt on everyone and can get anyone to do their bidding through coercion and blackmail. Pakistan will never change until the people do. And that will take centuries. 

The only way forward is to boycott the Army on EVERY level!

I know a lot of people are saying things like legacy and changing mindset and what not. The only thing that needs to change is COAS. If a Army chief favourable to IK comes, everything will be the same, PTI will be made again, Khan will become PM again and the circus will continue. Only Army chief needs to change. People have been saying things like how IK has shown the true enemy, No, if you are not a blind supporter you would have know who the enemy was back in 2018 as well when PTI was made to come in power. Even after everything, IK says establishment to intervene in politics but on his behalf and not against him

I have said this before on this forum. Its a cycle that all parties eventually go through in Pakistan.

MNS has been a long time critic of the bois. He has been beating this drum as far as I can recall. Yet the impact and force of IK's version of this struggle will have long lasting effects, and it makes MNS bouts with the bois seem like childs play.

I'm not worried about PTI. We will have more parties. We won't have another country. We all need to think about Pakistan at this stage, and not a party or individual. For Imran Khan, he is a different beast. His mindset is different. Don't you worry about him.

Whatever happens, he did like Leonidas and showed us that even the ones who rule over us, are still human.

I think it’s the end. The struggle will go on but the party has been greatly damaged.

Leaving under pressure is not leaving, they have just taken a break instead of 'forced divorces', we all know!

This is the END of the illusion called Pakistan. There is no moral reason left for this country to exist anymore. My Grand Parents Hijrah in the name of Islam has been betrayed.

I genuinely believe the all political leaders are sincere. The only difference we see is that when Imran Khan gives call for protest, Neither Imran Khan or any senior leadership is seen. This results in protest turning into a violent mob.

Jb tk pti ka voter imran khan k naam pe vote de ga tb tk pti ya imran khan ka end ni hoskta.Period

Fawad Chaudhry resigns from party position and parts ways from Imran Khan



Nice! Let this miserable situation end quickly. 

**Wake me up when our country becomes Somalia**. 

There’s already too much competition in the daaku industry. So I’m gonna buy a dingy boat and become a pirate. 

Unemployed guys and gals can join my pirate crew. Limited spots are available and I’m already getting a lot of applications for joining my crew. So be quick!

I saw hamid mir shitting on him on twitter. These journalists used to smile and dance for these guys but it’s all a joke

This will continue. According to IK, they threatened a political worker's 13 year old son will be abducted, and IK himself told the worker "leave now, save your family". 

Apparently, someone has lost their legs. Shot and then eventually jsut cut off. The barbarity is going insane.

Dont blame these guys tbh, the stuff that's being done to them is absolute depraved and while strong individuals can withstand torture the horrific threats to family would certainly be the breaking point for most. 

Anyway with God's grace IK essentially has a chance to develop PTI 2.0 and go for a new beginning except he has significantly more startup capital than 1996 in the form of being by far the most popular candidate for prime minister potentially in the country's history. Lets see what he does with this second chance

Honestly the burden is on the people, not these politicians. If you want change you don't need a political party to tell you it's time to seek it. I hope people don't get bystander effects from this because that's exactly what the government and army are trying to implement. 

If you have nobody to follow then you have no cause. People need to become selfish for their own personal rights.

Big L for PTI. Bro was one of my favourite politicians in the party. He may not have done that much as the MoST, but still at least something to show, unlike others in this position. Science fairs, taking on the Ruet e Hilal, participating in some science discussions...

The fact that this is so blatant is ammunition for PTI. Everyone needs to support IK regardless of what happens now. There is no semblance of democracy anymore and any election is a sham until PTI has been restored. The more the Generals out themselves the better.

I heard from somebody about Usmar Dar's video in which he said that they are pressurizing him to leave otherwise they'll ra\*e his wife or smth.

I'll check to see if it is true but I won't be surprised if it is

He realized he had to sprint a lot more if he stayed in PTI.

It was fun while it lasted

Whatever is going on in Pakistan, the blame is on the people of Pakistan. If only 1-2% people come out on street,,, 

but sanu key, “Ik is doing all this for kursi”

I blame my relatives, I blame People of Pakistan. We are not a nation.

Jab tak ye randi fauj iss mulk mei hai kuch nai hosakta - Allah iss fauj ko gharat kare

You notice how IK isn't doing anything and his plan to expose the mafia is being carried out by the mafia themselves. Iks greatest and most valuable accomplishment has been just that.. what the citizens do is totally dependent on whatever type of life they want to continue on with from now on.

now i hope ik disbands pti and leaves this shithole for good

Lumber win 🥇

Welcome to the Syria style police state. It's setting up the future of what is going to happen to Pakistan.

I officially declare Malik Riaz and Maryam Nawaz as the most powerful people in this country.

I liked Fawad Chaudhry. He was fun to listen to and was funny sometimes. Too bad he has been forced to leave :(

Can IK compete in all the seats for national assembly and winn everyseat? Goes to show who the real leader is

Poor guy was probably threatened by ISI

They can't hurt Imran Khan without tons of negative press so they are hurting those around him.

In hindsight Imran Khan could have become friends with either PPP or pml to keep them from coming together

Finally bro I follow politics really hard an this guy was the most incompetent couch surfer on PTI. Mf couldn't stop crying after being arrested. I'm actually starting to think these resignations are working in IK's favor. Get these losers out!

These people must have humungous amount of pressure. Most of us do the same thing to save our family.

well, the army brought them into power, and now the army is dismantling them. People like to think PTI and IK have been different but not really. It's the same political music chairs as the decades of Pakistani politics.

Musharraf -&gt; PPP -&gt; PTI -&gt; PMLN?

Does anyone know if overseas Pakistanis are able to stand as a member of PTI party, as this will then ensure the members can not be arrested or assaulted by the authorities in Pakistan?

Much in the same way other party members such as Nawaz Pleet ‘sharif’ is sitting in U.K. and still a member of the party

PTI is done-up. Wonder what good its done for the supporters whose lives may have been ruined. I just hope the ideological win echoes into the future. 

_The coming generations always benefit from the sacrifices of the previous generations._

Dayyum. PTI messed with the wrong people.

Remember that Bacha Khan spent 37 years in jail, Mujib Ur Rehman 12 years and Asif Ali Zardari 14 years. So-called patriots could not spend a week in prison without foregoing their mantras about Azadi and Ehtesab and leaving politics altogether.

In the age of social media and smartphones, ya'll are telling me not a single party worker who was tHrEaTeNeD posted a video to Twitter or Reddit or Facebook or TikTok?

Or CNN or Al Jazeera or ARY or Bol?

Idk I find it hard to believe IK/PTI saying they were threatened so violently (I'm going off of what I've read in this thread, eg- rape, being shot, having legs cut off?!)

I don't doubt that the army threatens ppl but I think it's more along the lines of financial/personal corruption that they're blackmailing ppl with. Wrong either way, but stop the sensationalism.

The leaders of PML-N and PPP exhibited considerably more bravery, defiance, and grit despite confronting significantly greater pressure and longer prison terms.

good riddance

So whose going to be new lord of Winterfell 🤔🤔

Imran Khan: Your captain will stand till the last ball and till the last drop of blood. Under no circumstances should the people lose faith.



He’s giving his all. I wanna know how students can help him out.

this gives me strength

Imran Khan is truly Pakistan's Man of Steel.

What a hero! I Love you Khan saab.

Honestly, he will go in the history books as a fearless leader who risked it all.

With him till the end. PDM shills and defeatists can seethe, rot and whatabout all they want. IK has brought a vision to the masses and they will never kill that vision.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Nothing else in the world…not all the armies…is so powerful as an idea whose time has come.” – Victor Hugo

 More power to you. Let them do what they think is right.

Khan has already won they can’t even beat him altogether in elections with rigging so they are stooping low, they have lost the love of this generation and coming to thanks to the internet.

Needed to hear this after all the resignations and top leadership stepping down 😔

Asim Munir se khuda poochay ga iA.

Indian fan of IK  America &amp; India should help him form a democracy . and have a peace agreement for next 50 year with india

Same said Muhammad Ali Jinnah, same said Fatima Jinnah, these people killed them all. Nothing and no one is too sacred for them. Power above everything. Money above all.

Just a cavet we have Imran Khan within ourselves, we been shown whats the right way to do things.By principles we as individuals can change the status quo.Even if he goes his legacy is there for everyone of us.Life is difficult and challenging but we don't give up. Trust on Allah swt and tread the road with grit and truth  In sha Allah we can overcome anything in our paths.We can change this system, it be hard and difficult, but we must believe in ourselves to want a change
Amongst ourselves we have young blood ,young leaders.We can make a change by refusing whats is wrong,and choosing whats right.Never ever give up ,this is a mental challenge and a moral challenge. Or we can go back to this corrupt system and become slaves to our masters.We do have a choice,pick the right one.

Great Khan always fought till the last ball. People said just build a clinic you will not able to raise money for Cancer hospital in a developing country like Pakistan. He made the impossible possible.

Watch the speech for better points. 

He seem to be on an **unofficial house arrest**. Flow of communication is limited (as he mentioned in the speech).

Ya Allah please keep this man safe and protect him from everyone who has ill intentions towards him

Tell it to your top brass, IK. How quickly they fell is embarrassing. They barely put up a fight for us, for their and our rights. 

And IK needs to stop cowering and playing the backfoot. He didn’t name and shame, he’s not going out on any protest, he didn’t demand the SC step in, he didn’t call out the military… 

I don’t know about you guys, but IK just completely gave in. This isn’t a fight, this is a “acha chalain ap batain” BS

Love you Kaptaan ❤️

They allowed the attacks of 9th May and now they are creating an impact that it was PTI supporters who burn the Jinnah House etc.

Long live Pakistan, &amp; IK. inshALLAH, you will rise again with more power and dignity, and fame.

PTI leadership avoided jail but buried IK.
NS is/was lucky to have Ahsan, Rana, Parvez, Khawaja etc.

He looks down

He’s gonna go back to being the prime minister of twitter

Ap ne apne workers ki khabar hi nai li jo thaano me maar khaa khaa kar behaal hain. Wik police walay ki voice suni in workers ko maar maar ke keh rahe thay k kahan hai ab tumara IK or PTI k leaders.

People should keep being my human shield and under no circumstances allow NAB to question me about my corruption cases.

Jani after disowning 9 may protestors:

The boys really have destroyed the biggest political party of the country. General Asim Muneer is beating Imran Khan very badly and will be looking to ban PTI so they wouldn't get the chance to fight in the coming elections. I guess this is the end of Imran Khan and PTI.

Reminds me of Prophet Ibrahim’s story of fight against the biggest evil of his time.

Why is his blood in London? They should be here too with poor people on street. He wants other people blood on street but not his own?

just fuckoff already u delusional drug addict

I hope that one of these days, he gives one of these video messages in his 92 "tiger" shirt. That will be a Chad GOAT Sigma move...

Imran Khan's reaction to ISPR Presser: ISPR sahab I was representing Pakistan internationally before you were even born...I spoke in support of army internationally...it was the Army Chief who brought defamation to the army...shame on you...people will not accept these leaders.



Immi is the best 

ISPR took a big L

Khan Sahab not coming slow

DG ISPR will cry to sleep tonight.

cornered tiger just took the first shot

Bravo 👏 call them out!! They are going to try to harm him anyway so better he speaks up.

ohhh boy......i can feel his anger. Somehow he is restraining himself.

IK should have started this reply with:

"Dekhein DG ISPR sab sbse pehle to apne Rona ni hai"

Cut from a different cloth. You can dislike him but can’t deny his guts 😬

Height of popularity of the Army in my life time was in 2000 and in 2019

Immu Bhai 💚

What a well rounded speech

Dil khush kar diya

He has no choice but to push back hard or they will put him in jail

Lol…. Brave man…. This is the right way to call these goons

This is what we expected from every other PTI "leader".

None rose up. He should think about that.

Anyone got a link to what the ISPR said that Imran khan is responding to?

😂😂😂 damn ispr gonna cry today

As an overseas Pakistani, i am just appalled by people who still support nawaz family or ppp. I dont endorse imran khan fully, but i do believe this guy is genuine. At this very moment there is an urgent need of setting differences aside and try to get the economy back on track. I am not sending any remittances to Pak until these theives are running the country. No way.

Yahudi suar fauj 🐶

Good to see a Pakistani politician finally talking like this.

Sakht launda.

FUGG THE DJ-ISPR!

IK ❤️

Allah salamat rkhay, I am worried about IK, he’s not coming slowly and that might give him a lot of trouble

Love him or hate him, he's speaking FACTS.

ISPR ka phar k rakhi

Immi not holding back

Edit: I should also add that Immi should have the bllas to say that I supported you when you made me amend a law that increased the jail time for citizens of they said anything against NaPak army.

If Immi says this and openly says that it was a mistake, I will have respect for him.

Immi chan

Imran khan is the Face of public reaction. Public has now evolved the new generation is no longer in the mood to remain suppressed and they intend to move forward by enabling with better economic opportunities and education. The old ways simply is no longer valid , the faster the elites and decision makers understand the easier will be the transition! Bottom line transition is inevitable

The people do not accept the terrorist generals that hijacked the Federations of Pakistan and burned it to the ground, The generals must pay for all their crimes, High treason must be paid in full via capital punishment

&amp;#x200B;

GHQ Is the mother of all terrorism

THEY ARE MASS MURDERERS AND RAPISTS

People of Pakistan reject the Army headed by Mir Jafars!

Chass aa gayi bawa g

Did he really say, " log Chuttiyan hain....." or was I hallucinating?

The way he uses YouTube as a bully pulpit is quite interesting. Breaking the 4th wall and making the audience listen to his speeches which are usually the same (except this one of course)

THE KING MAN, HE IS THE KING! THE REAL ESTABLISHMENT OF PAKISTAN!!

The Real Top G

What a GIGACHAD

One thing i don't understand from Imran fans is that how are you guys justifying the very obvious 190 Million pound "favor" that he handed out to Malik Riaz ?  
I mean one can argue about the method of arrest but if the court seems it necessary to have him arrested for the Al Qadir Trust case, then what's the issue ? I thought we were against corruption ? Or is it okay for Imran to be corrupt but not okay for everyone else ?  
Also how are you reconciling with Imran's hypocrisies ?   
Exhibit 1. He himself admitted to using agencies to get bills passed in the NA  
Exhibit 2. He himself admitted that Bajwa used to come to him with dirt on his opponents ?  
So was that all Halal for our Sadiq And Ameen ?   
Seriously I do not understand this at all. Are we okay with the Army interfering as long as it is against Imran's opponents ? He himself said "They are afraid If a good Army Chief comes, he will go after their corruption" (paraphrased but that's kind of what he said). Since when is it the Army Chief's job to go after corruption ? and why was Imran seemingly okay with that idea ? According to his own standards, if the Army Chief is coming after him for "corruption" than why is not okay now ?  
And the whole " I made Pakistan so famous when you weren't even born" argument, is the stupidest pettiest dumbest thing I have heard from a 70 year old. It reeks of ego and nothing more. So apparently it's okay for Imran to say whatever because "oh 20 years ago he did this and that" like come on guys. We need to get out of this fanboy mentality to go anywhere.

Haha. This has turned into a Saas Bahu opera now. 😅 Rasoday mein kaun tha? Tum thi? Mein thi? Ya Rashi thi? 😅

Great!

bruh just wont stop begging for the seat

Lie after lie, that's only immi is good at and personality parast followers will believe anything he's say.
Zero ethics, zero sacchai, foul language, spreading lies.

He wasnt supporting ARMY .. musharaf took him into parliment first time in 2003 with just one seat and he back-lashed him and now again back lashing army because they are not supporting him anymore .. Bajwa did right with him .. he is a CIA asset ! .. leka ay na apne bacho ko jo Jamaima k pass hain .. yea PEERNI k bachay to sirf mazay loot rahy hain .. bharam bazi krte hain yea log ab

Did I heard it correctly ? 3:16 mai is ne "... log ch\*\*ya hain.." kaha hai ?

A Question to Imran Khan Enthusiasts

Humans have an innate desire to strive for goodness and perfection, but due to their fallibility, they can be misled into believing that what they are pursuing is good when, in reality, it may be bad. 
I see many young minds around me supporting Imran Khan wholeheartedly and posting stories in his favour. However, it is worth asking whether this support is based on ideological and rational reasons or just on the personality of the man himself.

When asked about their reasons for supporting Khan, PTI followers often cite his Oxford degree, his English-speaking skills, and his ability to challenge or mock his opponents. But rarely do they delve into the ideals or ideology that he stands for. This begs the question: Is Imran Khan winning support through substance, or is he simply manipulating the frustration of a hope-starved nation?

Please reflect on this question with honesty for once.

tbh, most of the people don't know about his Oxford degree, people support him as they have seen him grow, heard stories of him, from winning the World Cup in 92 to building cancer hospitals, he was one of the most popular people in pakistan before entering politics. 

IK has been very clever in using social medias, a platform that has increase this reach and popularity amongst the youngsters, secondly, PTI and IK to some extent are the only party that seem to push for new faces to come into politics. You have PPP and PMLN on one side where familial politics have produced "politicians" like Maryam and bilawal, both are literally incompetent. 

The ideological part is also there, I mean who wouldn't want a person who promises to trial all the corrupt politicians. IK is in no way perfect, he has made dumb mistakes but the only problem is, his opponents are PDM, literally 100x more dumber and incompetent so yeah, its either an Oxford graduated playboy turned philanthropist or a bunch of incompetent parties that haven't done shit for the country with decades of rule

I have never seen anyone cite his OXFORD DEGREE or english speaking skills of all things when talking about why they're voting for him. That being said I think it's a very simple reason to vote for him, and that is that all the alternatives are far far far worse. Really nothing deeper than that.

My pov as a 17 year old in Pakistan who is here since last 4 years. 
Firstly, I would like to start by saying I don't know much about politics nor am an economist. So I will be able to talk about stuff as far as my eye can see.

Now for Imran Khan or pti, I hated the fact that dollar was rising. I hated that everything was getting more expensive. You know all this stuff. That's mostly what I hated like that's it.

What I loved: I live in Abbottabad which is in KPK so first benefit was sehat Sahulat. It has been of immense help especially since my mom has cancer.
Secondly I liked the changes made to the educational system. Some might say this isnt a big deal but believe me it is. The content is so old you can't believe it. Literally, the syllabus my mom had done was still being taught in the same rattu manner.

The construction of the dams. Although, of course, it definitely is nowhere near complete, it is a good step. 

Steps taken to promote agricultural growth. The numbers spoke for themselves.

Promotion of local production, etc, now it just might have been a lucky timing, but the number of brands that opened/started manufacturing in Pakistan was good. Many Chinese car manufacturers came. Mg too, started being imported, and as far as I know, it is also produced locally. Samsung started assembling in Pakistan. Now all of this isn't too beneficial (for the common person) but in the long run it is definitely something to be reckoned.

As I said, I don't know about the economy, but as far as I know, it was going in a positive direction? Feel free to correct me or provide more info.

Edit: Forgot to mention that I used to cry about the USD ratio pkr situation alot until I got to learn about the artificial rate thing which still makes me go mad to this day.

Edit 2: Forgot to mention how well we handled covid, we were even made an example for other countries by WHO.

Also tourism got a great boost. Its not something I am saying because I heard it. I've seen it on YouTube alot. Many YouTubers came here after ptis governance. Again could be lucky timing for pti but we can't know for sure.

Ooh ooh, another one. More just keep on coming lol. No more drone attacks when he came. This one definitely isn't coincidental.

Another one lol, he took steps for evm and also wanted to let overseas Pakis practice the right to vote. But ofcourse fair elections hazam nhi hone and overseas are majority with pti so it couldn't happen.

Another one, he spoke about Muslims and Islamophobia in UN. His body language tells he is proud to be PM of Pakistan. He doesn't look like he is in fear that he will say something wrong. He knows what he stands by

I had literally no idea about his degrees or qualifications before a few months ago.

And before he came into government, I only knew he hated PMLN due to various reasons, mainly what he went through and what his wife went through in Nawaza Tindo's days. I wasn't really enthusiastic then. 

But in his government, I actually saw things getting better for the lower middle class, and even lower class folks. It was kinda surprising. Ehsas program is great, but what I support him for is the sehat card. It was a game changer.

This family, ghareeb and barely surviving, was told their daughter had to give birth through C section but they couldn't pay for it. Guess what? Someone told them about the sehat scheme, the only thing they paid for was their food at the hospital. That's it.

It's hard not to support a dude that managed to do this not just for one family, but for millions.

will be honest, Pakistan is in a very bad place and just needs any time of good leader with a good moral compass.

Imran Khan fits the bill, although he may not be on the top of the political spectrum, he does stand for good values such as health, environment, anti corruption (well, less corruption than compettiors).

Simply put, he may not be the best but he's the best of the bunch.

Besides a very few of the voters of JI and PTM, no one votes on the basis of ideology here.

Imran Khan is not a visionary or ideological leader. But expecting him to have principles is unfair to him. Pakistani politics doesn't allow growth for any ideological leader. 

Even Jinnah made alliances with corrupt feudal lords to get votes for Pakistan resolution and the referendum against Abul Kalam.

I am not IK’s voter because I dont think that he can solve Pakistan’s problem, I dont think he has a plan and I dont agree to his ideology but I get it when people in Pakistan support him. You have to look at the alternatives. Alternatives are SS, NS, BB MN and their gang and they are they are compromised and can be controlled by establishment. Another alternative is army rule which no sensible Pakistani should support. 

If you believe in democracy then you have to choose someone to rule the country. IK has flaws but he has the genuine support of people and I respect that.

 i support his ideologies.
His manifesto states that his government would make reforms for an Islamic welfare state.
Sehat card, Ehsaas program gave me the evidence that even with limited resources he wouldn't stop.
His manifesto also explained the need to deal with climate change. He started Tree plantation projects among others.

Exports were on the rise. Economic indicators were good. COVID-19 was very well managed.

Honest, sincere leadership. Pakistan did well on the foreign policy front too.

Khan has no alternatives. Not even close.

Lesser of the two evils

A few facts:

1. The naPak bhoj is the most corrupt and manipulative gang in the country (can be discussed in detail if you like) 

2. PDM parties have their own flaws. PPP and PMLn had their prime years but now have delved into corruption and nepotism. (Any party can be discussed) 

What we are left with are PTI or too small ethnic/religious parties. 


PTI is by no means perfect and I won't take a second to change if a better (and new option) comes along but it is the best choice among what we got.

Pakistan is like at least a century of development away before people vote based on ideology and policies lolololol.

As it stands the nation is a corrupt shithole and so the country needs someone who wants the best for the country rather than the best for their bank balance. His record tells us that he's not in it for the money and for me and a load of other people that is good enough.

Imran khan is more a celebrity than a politician, I voted for him twice in 2013 and 2018. Given the choice, i would chose Ik over corrupt nepotism based mafias like Sharifs or bhuttos anyday. But i have learnt over the years that IK is more like a child in Politics, who cries around the house and breaks the crockery when he doesn't get his way. 

Recent events have made me more repulsive to Cult minded IK supporters and i personally think he shall disavow the violence and violent protests to save image (If there is any left). The guy failed badly after he secured central Gov in 2018. I was hopeful after his promising attitude and innovative policies in 5 years tenure in KPK. But Manipulative retards like Tareen, Aleem and Fawad have forces him into very bad decisions.

P.S: before the vultures gather round let me clarify I abhor the PDM and hate them tenfold already.

Finally a sensible question. All of his followers are just like sheep’s herd being driven by his populist cult. People say, he is with a ”moral compass” well if you are a soft spoken for Taliban, had MQM and “daku” as your coalition partners, that’s a lot of moral compassing. 
Also, his three years are the most incompetent in terms of governance. Corruption was on rampage. How Imran Khan gave safe channel to Malik Riyaz millions of pounds through setting up trust. Read Alqadir trust case, it’s a very legitimate corruption case. He also allowed black money in real estate without any questions being asked. I thought he had a moral stance against corruption? There’s many other incompetent and corrupt practices that I can mention here. 
Point being, he is equally responsible for the mess and that too without any accountability and know-how of governance. Man just likes the attention, and riding the best populist wave of his life. Just tell me a day in our political life from 2014, where he hasn’t wrecked a havoc in politics. 
PS. He isn’t animti establishment. If ( and that’s highly unlikely) je becomes to power , he will be sitting in establishments lap. Stop pinning your hopes on the man who is paranoid-level self-obsessed so called messiah. He openly said I don’t take responsibility for the protests. Take that.

The most common response I get to questions like this is “he’s the lesser of two evils,” but that really doesn’t explain the level of fervent support they give him. It’s because A). he’s extremely anti-PDM, which they also hate and B). they’re wrapped up in a cult of personality and don’t want to admit it. 

He’s not less corrupt, he’s just had less time in political power to exercise that corruption than the dynasty powers but there are still plenty of examples of it. He’s not a good leader, extremely hostile to anyone that disagrees and constantly hangs his supporters out to dry (like right now, the riots stopped because IK is free but what about the rest of the party leadership and 2,000+ supporters?). He wasn’t a good statesman, not particularly good at governance and terrible at foreign policy. He even has the same crooks like Pervaiz Elahi and his son in the party being promised high positions in a quid pro quo. 

The only reason he appears to be the lesser of two evils is because he’s had less time in power. Give him/PTI 10 years in power and you’ll have the same amount if not more examples of ineptitude and corruption than PDM. Even a cursory review of his track record will tell you this, but that’s what a cult of personality is for, to get you to ignore what’s in front of your face and swallow the rhetoric.

Depends what you think is right or wrong.

Do you stand for justice, getting rid of corruption, improving education, feeding the poor, providing free healthcare and putting Pakistan's interests first is important?

Or do you think corruption cannot be avoided and we don;t need to focus on it, cracking down on peaceful protestors is fine, manipulating judges and institutions to get out of cases is acceptable, bowing down to the West is necessary, and joining with political rivals to save status quo is good?

A Choice of less Corrupt i would say, The Reason for the revival of Imran khan's Popularity is the stupidity of the opposition (Army and PDM) and the economic hardships
in the Last one Year alone All Pakistanis have lost 2/3 of their Purchasing power
This is while PDM is in Power and our fiancé minister whose only qualification is that he is a relative of Nawaz Sharif

When people ask this question they are also not being honest with themselves - ask yourself why does so much of our population back Imran Khan when a year ago he seemed likely to lose any opinion polls. I usually ask myself what proof will I need to question some of my staunchest beliefs and it usually tells me what biases I am carrying so I suggest everyone to ask themselves the same thing..

To answer your question - people I know who support him do not do so for anything you mentioned, they say they are sick of the status quo and want to jolt the system so people at the helm can FOR ONCE look into doing meaningful reforms. Imran Khan is not an outsider, comes from an elite family, was a national hero YET struggled decades and had to shake hands with military to spend 3 years in power. Was then immediately kicked out by the old guard to tell us all that no one but select few families and one institution are welcomed in power. Same group that has lead Pakistan into being the only country that is going for it’s 23rd IMF programme (and even struggling to get that)

Politicians debate ideologies when they are not being cut down to size by powers that be, so it is a fight for survival. I personally back him right now because of our basic right of elections that is getting violated by people who think they are above the law and have some hereditary right to rule the country

I'll tell you; IK is doing the same things Trump did in the US of A. He called out the elephant in the room. It really is as simple as that. 
No matter if you live in Louisiana or Lahore, you know politicians all sound the same. When IK speaks, he's not talking politically weighted, calculated, loaded points. No, what he's saying hits home for everyone no matter who or where they are. He's the Zinger Burger being introduced to a public that's been fed Aanday waala burger with gandi daal ki patty kebab! 
And that's why the pooblic looves him so.

he is the best we have among all the options so yea...

This is a troll post without any sincerity. People do not like him for his Oxford degree and English skills. They like him because he genuinely managed good change in the short time he was in power. Compare the rollout of the sehat card and the ehsaas program with the "free atta" scheme by the showbaz government and you can see the difference clearly in who is actually effective at governance and good management.

Whoever the PDM opposes, I'm going to support them, even the TLP, but I hope the situation doesn't come to that.

What a load of BS.

It's the usual alt accounts coming out of the woodwork.

I've never seen a single person mentioning his "Oxford Degree".

The support him because the alternative are convicted criminals with 4+ decades of corruption, nepotism and incompetence. The PPP and PMLN are disingeous and have destroyed Pakistan.

Every PDM supporter has been a disingenuous, insincere troll or someone who stands to personally benefit from PDM Corruption.

I think it would be far more useful and pertinent in posing this question to PDM "Supporters"

he has no personal business interests, only the business interests of the community.

even before he was a politician, he was doing comminuty service. SK.

you mentioned an oxford degree, yes that too. its a huge advantage to have a PM with a degree for once. all other nora kushtas have minimum bachelors (BA), jinkominimum wage job py koi na rakhy wo politician bn jata hy.

 he thinks big. he thinks in longer terms. he thinks for his country before him.

his anti-dynastic policies. I mean kia Pakistan main leadership k qabil 2 he families reh gai hain? kia un families main paida hony waly hr bachy k naseeb main PM bn'na (alternatively) likha hy?

the list can go on, but if you have not seen it yet, you are not going to be convinced by a reddit post.

Sehat card , ehsas program , panahgah and Pakistan Citizen portal inspired us.

OP are you okay buddy ? Have you seen the state of the PDM? I cannot take this question seriously.

Edit: Ah I see it's the same clown that posts all his alts on on PakistaniConfessions

Disclaimer : I'm like a 16 yr old pakistani living abroad so I really don't know much. But here is what I think.

It's a bit of both, people site IKs Oxford degree, his English speaking skills and ability to actually answer the question being asked without stuttering because that means he is competent for the role. The prime minister if a country represents the country, and people want to see someone representing their country that actually makes them look good. 

But also, in decades from what I understand. IK is the only one who has promised to irradiate corruption. The  thing that's plagued this country for so ling and has caused so many problems. But obviously it takes time an organisation as big as our army. 

Ik opposition also sites the value of PKR to prove that IK was ineffective but people have realised the value of the ruppee doesn't represent if the country if slowly dying or flourishing. Before IK the PKR was steady at around
 100 - 120 pkr per euro. But there was still a lack of electricity etc. While during IK it jumped to around 200 pkr per euro, other things like electricity improved immensely. 

Now my final reason why I think IK is support is so big, 
He is the only one in leadership that actually seems to care about our country and planet in the ling term. For example the cancer hospitals and the project to plant 1 billion trees in pakistan. Both of which were really successful. 

This is just what I think though, and I'm not close to actual voting age so i haven't done enough research yet.


Edit : fix spelling, bcs I didn't proof read ffs.

Honest guy who despite his faults actually cares about the country and is willing to give his life for it. Not many like him around.

1. First of all, most of his enthusiasts don't even know his background in education, nor does he speak as good of English as others, Benazir for example. He mostly speaks Urdu with his people. What resonates with people is his openness to the public and honesty, and pain for a common Pakistani, and selflessness.
2. Secondly, the common people of Pakistan have been betrayed and played-with for at least 76 years. You have to understand, these people went through so much hatred, struggle, humiliation and cruelty during the years of struggle for independence and then migration and then never saw the Pakistan they have dreamed of. So, for the first time, they see a light at the end of the tunnel. Honestly, no disrespect intended, but even if Muhammad Ali Jinnah was here today, he would have been maligned with some sort of corruption; and may not have been as popular as IK. Real life example is what they did with Fatima Jinnah.
3. Thirdly, he is truthful. He is courageous to stand for the people. He is non-violent. He is peaceful. He stands for justice. People don't want your sophisticated nonsense. They want to be heard and echo their cries in clear and simple language. That's what he is good at. And you cannot do that if you are not sincere.
4. Lastly, and personally, I hate when people paint him with doubts, or less corruption (none proven), or lesser evil (no evidence). Really??? How the hell sincere are you to this country? How much corrupt are you? How much evil are you? ISN'T HE BETTER THAN YOU IN EVERY RESPECT of life??? I'm damn sure, he is. Don't consider him an angel. Maybe you are in awe by Biden, or Putin, or Bush or Blair or someone else, I mean which leader is better than him, in respect of thinking of good for his people. He even thinks of other ethnicities and nations. I think he is THE BEST. He is the uplifter in the making. He is the history in the making. And I am not saying, I am not his fan (as some of you cowards/hypocrites do). I AM HIS FAN. If I see any good in politics, him only, is the statue of that good.

People who support Imran Khan are impervious to logic. They only like him because he was apparently good looking in his youth and dated a lot of white women. They have memory of a goldfish and won't remember any red flags of PTI. Plus use of music in his jalsas turned a lot of people in his favour. People wanted to be seen as cool. PTI understands social media marketing and how algorithms work. They have used it to mobilise support. He used the right words when it came to Islam, and you know how Pakistani people are - the idea of this playboy turned Islamist is like everything to them. (Don't you remember how people were crazy after Christian Betzmann despite him having no personality? Any Pakistani who can convert goras to Islam is a national hero.) Plus he demonised his opponents so if you stood against him, you were automatically assumed to align with chor and luterey. Paid PTI trolls would harass anyone who dared question his narrative. Read the book "21 Lessons for 21st Century" by Yuval Noah Harrari. The role of social media for social engineering will then make a lot more sense. PTI is the prime example of it.  

My question to PTI supporters:

- How do you justify Imran Khan supporting his Islamophobic Zionist rich buddy over a Muslim for London Mayor Campaign?

- What happened to Amreeki Sazish? Why are PTI supporters begging for help from American senators when I thought you guys hated Amreeka

- Why is Imran Khan supporting Malik Riaz? There's a reason he has been banned from the UK. He is the actual mafia in this country no one talks about.

In the end, people are frustrated. Even if a donkey stood with the right marketing strategy, people will support him..

P.S. Bring in the downvotes, paid PTI bots. But never provide any logical answer to any of my questions.

Cancer hospitals, Social welfare policies, focus on education, clean water, dams and childrens health? The others literally do not have time to focus on any public policy besides vanity projects or their own wealth. Where have you been the last 20 years if you imagine people talk about IKs degree or English skills? I think people will question your sincerety with this question as its completely contrary to what we know about Imran Khan.

The party has its flaws. They had to navigate the corrupt systems and they had to deal with the army, who are obviously very powerful.

As a double degree holder in accounting and economics, as well as a licensed chartered accountant, I support Imran Khan for the following reasons:


1. His policies to help the economy recover will work given time. Some may be unpopular with the general public but they are the only way. Repayment of debt and sustainable increase in productivity and exports is the only way.

2. He correctly recognized the textbook corruption of the other parties. It's one of the oldest tricks in the books. Steal government contracts and have companies owned by you and your corrupt spawn to "complete" those contracts. Look at Sri Lanka. That is our future under PDM. It might be much worse due to the nature of our enemies which Sri Lanka didn't have. 

3. He has charisma on an international level. He doesn't need to memorize speeches. May seem like a tiny point but plays a huge role in the image for the country.

4. As far as I can tell, he is not bound to serve foreign agents because he holds little to no assets abroad. He can therefore take decisions to benefit Pakistan rather than foreign nations.

5. He unifies various ethnicities within Pakistan rather than play on their differences to win support.

6. He has actually proven that he can fulfill his promises. He created the SK hospital and it is internationally recognized. The same goes for his billion tree tsunami project.

I support Imran khan because he's lesser evil.

Nawaz/Zaradri is the only alternative to PTI, whose fault is that?

Bhai kisi ko Facebook pe stalk nahi karna

While IK is in no way perfect and hes made plenty of dumb decisions, he took a bullet to the leg, a baton to the head, and had his house raided. You can't tell me he isnt fighting for the country

I asked all my family to vote for him, but I didn't agree with all of his policies. For example, when the PTI tried to reduce freedom of expression. One of their MNA introduced the bill to fine 500000 and 6 month jail to anyone who speaks against the army. It didn't get the time to approved otherwise, most of the PTI members would be in jail because of that. 

I also didn't agree when Imran khan victim blamed the woman. PTI is not known as an anti-establishment party. It was funny that a few years ago, their were called Selected, but the table have turned. Now, I supported them as a symbol to fight against the establishment. 

Also, like other commentators mentioned, he is the least worst choice we have. He is not corrupt. He understands the environmental issues we have. And I hope he will learn from their mistakes when given another chance.

OP write your own dang essay 😅

I would not use the word manipulation in this context, and the reason is he is not getting financial or social gains by it. I would rather use the word leverage. 
I would simply choose him because i like the projects his team wants to bring to life. Green energy, universal healthcare etc.

&gt; support is based on ideological and rational reasons or just on the personality of the man himself

Imran Khan : Root out corruption, provide free healthcare to poor, have a system that follows the law and is free of intervention, ensure that Pakistan's interests are put first and foremost.. That's how I see his ideology.

PDM: Corruption is inavoidable and must be allowed, cracking down on peaceful protesters is perfectly okay, shooting random civilians is fine, picking up journalists who say anything against you is okay, changing laws to ensure that cases against us are not allowed is good (look at NAB amdendment, better to simply bow down to the West, and joining with rivals we once called devils is perfectly okay as long as we get to take over the PM seat.

Is anything wrong in the above? Who should any rational person choose /u/hunter_xhunter18 ?

Imran Khan is a populist

He's called out the lawlessness of the Army. He's challenged them. He has broken the idol of the army and single handedly ended the indoctrination of this country. That is his biggest achievement imo.

Also he did a really good job handling the Coronavirus.

i don't know a thing about politics, but right now I think i'd like to see imran khan be given a proper opportunity as PM.  I've done but limited research but it seems the current PM is from a family of politician, which puts a bad taste in my mouth to begin with, but more importantly, this family has been involved in proven illegal activities. I'm all for giving every individual a chance regardless of what their family has done (i'm not aware if the PM himself has been involved in illegal activities that have been proven by court).   But I think it's time to give IK a proper chance now.

The current government is way too shady man. What they did the last few days was a bit scary, it made me feel the country is being run by goons trying to hide things by blocking off the internet and arresting people without warrants and killing them. It was unacceptable

During Imran khan's time, he did a few things like offering incentives and tax exemptions to technology companies and startups. This showed me a few things which earned my support:

&amp;#x200B;

1. He's willing to do things that may not be so flashy like a big metro channel, as long as it benefits the country in the long term
2. He understands where the world is moving, tech is a monster of an industry.
3. He has a vision to solve the country's poverty from the core, by increasing the country's revenue, rather than just doing things that make him look good immediately.  What this means is that he will probably not reap the benefits of his vision in his life time, but if the next few governments keep his vision going we will eventually get there.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, I'm keeping my hopes on a tight leash. IK is probably the best option we have right now, and if we're lucky he turns out to be as good as people hope for him to be.

Yes there is definitely an element of him manipulating a hope-starved nation.





However up untill his kerfuffle with Qandeel Baloch, there was very little ill-will by anyone towards him. So for decades the Pakistani populace only knew him in a good lens. So he’s the sabzey achcha aam peti mei.

These I have a question thread are bullshit narrative pushing.

Try harder, dude introduced biggest social programs, tried to fight corruption, introduced a lot of other good initiatives. His background is in philanthropy not looting.

Well since you haven’t seen enough people around you who support him for his ideology, count me in one of them who supports his ideals. I don’t care about world cup or hospitals or his ability to mock his opponents. 
Maybe increase the sample of study a bit to even out the stereotype you getting. Maybe your sample of people is limited?

I would agree with the latter which i believe is perfectly fine.

I am more than happy to support IK if it means an end to the political dynasties that have ruled this country in conjunction with the establishment for over 70 years.

You want real change? this is how you get it. One step at a time.

I dont idolize khan

But I mean... he's basically just the lesser evil for now

Between pdm and Khan

I would always choose khan regardless

I ABSOLUTELY loathe the Nawaz, Zardari, diesel gang

They didn't set up new industries as such but they did facilitate the existing industries to become more competitive and export.

lol this is the first time I’m hearing he has an Oxford degree

&gt; This begs the question: Is Imran Khan winning support
&gt; through substance, or is he simply manipulating the
&gt; frustration of a hope-starved nation?

&gt; Please reflect on this question with honesty for once.

This is a biased question, since it insinuates that Imran Khan is a bad candidate. Now - I don't know whether he is or whether is not. I am sure you can find fault in everyone.

The bigger issue, one that is overlooked, is that there is another fight going on - not solely about Imran, or any other candidate, but simply how the military behaves in Pakistan. In my opinion Pakistan is a military dictatorship right now - it's not as overblown as e. g. in Myanmar, but it is not a democracy either. In fact India actually has a better democratic system (and it has tons of problems too, including corruption, harassment against ethnic minorities and economic inequalities - but even aside from this it still works better than in Pakistan in regards to the **military** there).

There is a systemic problem with the military in Pakistan (I group the intelligence service into the same problem domain here). This problem will continue to handicap Pakistan again and again and again for years to come.

So the question really is NOT whether Imran is the-best-ever, but simply whether you (or anyone else) can fix the problem. Some believe that only Imran can fix it; I think an unpolitical grassroots movement would be better (e. g. how Gandhi operated; research a bit how he managed to undermine the old UK empire systematically and strategically until they no longer were able to exert their slavery in far-away areas).

Imran khan is not unlawfully abducting people. He is not callously shutting down internet services that affects millions of workers. Imran khan is asking for elections and adherence to the law. 

All the opposition parties and the army are doing unlawful crackdowns and destroying the economy through their mismanagement. This is why I support Imran Khan.

Imran Khan on Twitter: We had all heard about forced marriages in Pakistan but for PTI a new phenomenon has emerged , forced divorces. Also wondering where have all the human rights organizations in the country disappeared.



Unfortunately Human Rights in Pakistan consist of:

•Paid stooges or

• Delinquents with a Twitter Account that wish they were white

• Think Western Pop Culture is the benchmark for civilization

What a sad state of affairs our country is in. Everyone knows who is doing it and why, but we can’t do anything about it. I haven’t been so depressed seeing Pakistan sink so low into oblivion morally, politically, economically, and every which way in my lifetime before 💔

Khan Saab in humorous mood.

Kind of sad to see that.

quite a lot of people hate jibran nasir for many reasons  but the dude is just spitting facts and calling spade a spade in this entire scenario even though he himself is not a PTI supporter.

What about force marrieges in 2018 ??? I think he forgets about it.

Remember what Gobbles (Minister of Propaganda of Nazi Germany) said "For propaganda to be effective it needs to have an element of truth"

The selective outrage of human rights groups exposes them as political propaganda tools who only become active when their handlers tell them to. They only support the truth when the truth is alingned with their interests.

While I fully support IK in this it's ironic how he's now asking HR groups and the US to support him when he vilified them through his tenure in power and his live affair with the establishment

It’s not new. This is exactly how PTI was prepared for 2017 election. Except PTI was on receiving end and they use to call it “Zamer Jag gya”. Though everyone knew they were pressured into leaving other parties and joining PTI before and after elections.

If Shareef or Zardari had to experience an iota of troubles what IK has been going through, they’d run far far away. Not that they haven’t done that in the past. Kudos to IK for standing his ground and not running away to UK.

Git gud Khan sb

Human Rights orgs lol

Establishment brutality hit home, acknowledging brutality against balochis,

Just like the rest of the people in my part of the country (punjab), I've always ignored the military brutality against balochis and people in the tribal region and have always wholeheartedly bought the narrative that Pakistan army sold us against the separatist movements, but seeing how they're treating PTI activists and especially female members and sexual harassment against them merely their support for PTI and Imran Khan, I must admit that I was wrong and feel guilty, not only the balochis were right the entire time, they've the right to take up arms against Pakistani establishment if this is how they've been treated. It boils my blood with anger and frustration.

people say fauj hai to Pakistan hai, and Pakistan hai to hum hain. Couldnt be further from the truth. 

Every army needs a nation but not every nation needs an army. Pakistan hai to Pakistan fauj hai, not the other way. 

Pakistan  fauj takes this even further by justifying their existence by saying that if we don't exist you will die? really? if the fauj didn't do anything past 1948 or was slightly competent, we might still have Bangladesh, no Kargil, no war on terror etc. 

At the same time they suck a major part of the budget directly and indirectly control so much of the country to fund their DHA, their lifestyle, their investments in papa johns, swiss banks etc. 

And then some how the army chief has the balls to say we can't go to war with India, we don't have resources or equipment. then why do you exist? why make the country poor? go away and let the people fix this country! 

defend the borders and gtfo of everything else.

Everyone should start remembering 1971. This army committed atrocities in Bangladesh. 

All you were fed in books were lies and how Mukti Bahini was the real cause of Separation of Bangal. 

They never told you the truth. How they raped Bangali women and how innocent people were murdered. I have 2 Bangali friends whose families suffered through those and their stories were eye opening. 

Now they are doing the same but at a much less harsh rate. Imran Khan's statement that this has never happened before makes me chuckle cause he forgot 1971.

I think about how all this time until 2009 I sang army’s praises. Then idk how I end up reading foreign reports on Bangladesh and met Bengalis in US. Then I started to dig more and more; their face started to look more monstrous. Now after reading online the plight of Baloochis under army. The account of their brutality was given by military retirees who dissented from their superiors orders. First i thought generals were bad, but I have never seen Generals actually be on front. Killing is always done by the soldiers. Seeing the new footage from recent events, our soldiers carried the command and did what their commanders ordered. How many of them resigned and refused to carry the order . If they had done so we wouldn’t have 70+ killed in last few days. We have 6000-7000 arrested illegally with no records of their whereabouts or any warrants. Pakistan army is just a killing machine that is fine tuned to kill its own.

same bro. dont forget pashtuns too.

Porn army, enough said.

Did PTI had torture chambers? Did PTI burned people alive in a factory because they didn't receive bhatta? Did PTI do any suicide bombing? Did PTI attack and killed school kids?

I don't understand how people can compare PTI with TTP, BLA, MQM.

At least the people from big province see the misery of small provinces only after getting a tiny scratch compare to the hell Baluch and KPK went through.

I fully agree. People must always stand up for their rights. Balochis and Pashtuns have been fighting this naPak army for ever. We are getting to empathise with them now only because of what is happening here in Punjab. 

If the Pindi Boys do not change their ways against Balochis and Pastuns, I would regretfully but definitely support a East Pakistan type of revolution. Punjab is doomed due to it being the Home base of Pindi boys. But atleast my Balochi and Pashtun brothers and sisters should get independence from these oppressors.

Dar ayad dursat ayad

Literally TTP and BLA... Balochi outcry started happening once Kulbhushan got caught (who btw admitted to creating unrest in balochistan) + development of CPEC actually started going somehwere. Not to mention, the plethora of indian accounts being caught, masquerading around as Balochis. none of that ever strikes as suspicious?

Hamari fauj mei baray maslay hain. But to pretend all is fine in Balochistan and KPK, and that Iran, India and Afghanistan arent actively trying to incite violence in those provinces is naivety.

The establishment is treating people’s of Karachi the same brutal way since 20 years. I feel sad for balochis as well.

My point is this, America has been the biggest military might since WWII. However they couldn’t beat North Korean, Vietnamese. They couldn’t defeat Iraq or Afghanistan. Yes they killed a lot but they couldn’t stay there more than decade and Half. Now contrast this with India, if India were to attack Pakistan anytime since Separation. would they have enough resources and money to Keep Pakistan under occupation occupied?Pakistani people just through their Guerrilla warfare would have defeated India. So Military’s claim that if there is Fauj there is Pakistan is absolutely false. If India were to attack. Just people with simple AK47s would end Indian occupation. It’s people that fight and an army is only as strong as it’s people.

I'm glad that you are not afraid to admit your ignorance, i feel the same way as well.

The problem is that feudalism and tribalism does need to end and Bugti was a terrorist by all means. BLA is a majorly raw backed terrorist organization that does not want any peace or prosperity in Balochistan. You really think these land lords with their garages of Prados and Land Cruisers want to give up their power and actually obey the law ?   
But, just like every other institute in Pakistan our agencies/army have grossly violated their rights by abducting them. No one and I mean absolutely no one should be picked up in the middle of night and disappeared to an unknown location.  
The agencies must bring proper warrants, proper cases and allow anybody they suspect the right to a complete fair trial. Had our establishment followed proper procedures while fighting militancy and arresting people, we wouldn't be having this discussion.

They don’t have the right to pick up arms. They have the right to politics. But glad you got here. You are right.

Yeah. Read about Nizam-e-Adl Regulation and what happens when "brutality" is not unleashed on terrorists. There just is no other alternative. And stop brining provinces into it. Operation is underway for over a month now in Punjab against criminals in Kacha area, no Punjabi will never say "look brutality on Punjabis" or bring the province card like it would be in rest of the provinces. Only solution is to use force.

What you are seeing in Punjab, is just fair. You break things apart, you will have to face consequences. What were these kids thinking by openly showing their faces in the videos. Though I do feel bad for them because they are just kids and fell for the trap by the party leadership. Now they are being disowned.

Its Balochs not Balochis

IK arrested for one night and entire PTI becomes expert on 1971 and apologists for TTP / BLA.

How shameful is this post ... You guys forgot that TTP captured SAWAT in last three years and army taken it back and conducted operations there. BLA is not a friendly movement, they are backed by you know Shahzain Bugti who is a foreign agent. Furthermore, both balochis and pashtuns are traitor at all ... there are tribes fighting side by side with Pakistan Army in Balouchistan and Tribal Area .. have you forgot that TTP capture so much of tribal area in time when yusuf raza gilani was PM.   


Just tell me two things ?  
1) Why didnt Arif Alvi condemned this protest ?  
2) If it is staged, then why PTI workers joined them and attacked?

Yea GG segregation works call your self balochi that’s why places like Pakistan will never get ahead to busy giving our self’s fancy names while enemies destroy us but we remain in our cool little names. we don’t see each other as Muslim brothers and sister any more

These journalist and other thugs like ADIL RAJA giving you information which is not even proved to be true but you guys accept it as it appears before you. Now it is also promoted that Bangladesh did right in 1971. If it is so ? then why Bangalis have any respect in the world? Have some higher foreign reserves doesnt make a country great at all !

The army lies so much, That when people hear any other narrative, They biy it whole heartedly. As a result dumb takes like these start poppimg out. "Our army lied about Bengladesh wowwww we killed 3 million wowww". Just completely buying the opposite narrative, I get we all hate the establishment, But dont buy into seperatist BS. Yes extra judcial killimgs should be called out and development is needed there, But those people have killed Pakistanis, The Balochis hate them too. They are terrorists, Not to be sympathised with and have colluded with India. Kulbushan didnt pop out of GHQ, he was a high ranking Indian Navy officer. Again there needs to be development there but lets not excuse terrorism in the process.

You tried your best Mr. Khan, every war not meant to be won.

So guys, The Company has played well for themselves and PDM.
They had planned all of this. They used 9 May incident to crushed PTI.
They have captured his knights, bishop, rooks and pawns are sacrificing themselves becasue they are afraid. (Chess Analogy)
Welcome to the messed up country guys.

But I must say, Khan tried very very very hard, it is just that this nation is dead AF. 
Maybe his part was only to expose the company which is beautifully done.

Now nation will never love them and there will be some resistance everytime small or big, but it will be there.
Now Punjabi will speak about Balochis too.

Khan has won this. The company is Welcome to run ads, banners but the truth is thay nation will never forgive or love you.

Farewell Imran Khan :(

Let’s see if Awam give the Fauj the 1 finger salute on Election Day.

Maybe you are taking those resignations too seriously. Dont believe the news channels.They are all bought.

Agent Smith:   “You can’t win, it’s pointless to keep fighting! Why, Mr. Anderson? Why do you persist?”

Neo:   “Because I choose to.”

—The Matrix Revolutions

Sure, it's dark and pointless, but unless you choose to surrender, they can never change your mind.

Lol, if PTI is done then might as well declare the Sharif family eternal leaders of Pakistan. What is this defeatist mindset. IK isn’t done and nor is PTI. This is just a set back. Almost all youth votes belong to khan, a monkey could be given a election ticket (which would still be miles ahead of SS) and still win if he belongs to PTI. It isn’t all doom and gloom.

What the hell is up with these defeatist posts? Since morning all the sub has is posts around these.

Stop this defeatist attitude for once. You are an asset to this nation and the future. Even if you wanna go abroad, go. But you have and you will (InShaAllah) have a role to play in creating a better Pakistan in the near future.

IK has a purpose in front of him. Purpose never dies, and that's powerful!

Pak Army, you are going down in history as traitors. InshaAllah. Sad to say this but Pakistan ka Allah muhafiz rahay. Ghadaars are exposed but as you said murda qom hae.

Why are you posting so defeated like this? Khan isn’t giving up so neither are we. InshAllah he will be the next Prime Minister. The army generals and these PDM parties know only badmashi and it is bare for everyone to see. If Khan doesn’t defeat them, the economy will. Who in their right mind would invest in this country? Pakistan was surviving on overseas remittances and they are going to continue to decline because everyone overseas has seen this country isn’t worth the investment as long jungle law continues to prevail.

All people are thinking emotionally here.
Sorry if the post was not clear.
But think
1. Imran Khan's age
2. 80% resistance is only limited to the internet.
3. People are afraid now to take part in protest due to current arrests of people
4. Major people are leaving party. It is a parliamentary system, not presidential. You need many faces in your party.
5. Company and PDM has raped the constitution.
6. Courts are not being taken seriously, so it is marshal law already.

Lol, if PTI is done then might as well declare the Sharif family eternal leaders of Pakistan. What is this defeatist mindset. IK isn’t done and nor is PTI. This is just a set back. Almost all youth votes belong to khan, a monkey could be given a election ticket (which would still be miles ahead of SS) and still win if he belongs to PTI. It isn’t all doom and gloom.

I dont think its over yet. You are right about most parts. But politics is a game of possibilities and i am sure there will be many near elections. Lets see the pdm and establishment degrade.

Reddit is a free speech platform unlike your country values. Its good to have a positive mindset but its more important to respect other persons opinion. OP is right about many things.

Man stfu no one lost. Couple party hoppers resigning doesn't mean anything for PTI. Imran Khan's support has not been affected to the slightest from may 9 incident. In order to spread propaganda like they are doing the first step is to be respected and taken seriously which they totally missed 😂.

Everyone will remember pdm and porn army as criminals, ik will have the last laugh.

Lol, people want Azadi be thrown in their laps. You people really don't deserve it.

Nah. Stop with this nonsense. If that’s all the fight y’all had then y’all don’t even deserve a free Pakistan.

Dang, y'all really lost hope. I am not the biggest fan of PTI or Ik but get up boys. He ignited this fire, don't let it die so easily.

It is but a battle, the war is yet to be fought. I will always stand behind my murshid IK until he gets 2/3rd.

&gt;Now Punjabi will speak about Balochis too.

Press X to doubt. 

Punjab will revert to normal setting within 3-5 years just like it always did. Company will spend some good money on their base to rekindle support after they take out IK. Look man, IK knows this which is why he is thirsty for a deal with the COAS. Company knows this too, which is why they are cracking down hard and fast now.

IK wins, he and we take revenge by civil means and we all forget it down the line. it will be in history of Pakistan. (the most violent stuff was on 9th may)

IK loses, 10-15 years down the line, all of them are dragged in the streets and nobody ever forgets. goes down in history of the world. (the least violent one would dwarf the french revolution)

Allah kare is mulk ma koi behtri ajai

Allah imran khan ko himat de

Allah ik or leader paida karde is mulk ma

Allah ye saari qom ko ik karde

Allah yaha se gadaro ko hatade

Allah hamari awam ki ankhen khol de

Ae Allah joh Pakistan ke liye behter ha woh karde


Ameen

If you like getting raped and tortured, Hafiz is your man. That would be a great slogan for next election.

Imran Khan and his Awam. That's how it started. And if both these things stay intact then this too shall pass. IK next election main Shireen Mazari ko ticket dy, ya Faiz Ul Hasan chuhan ko ya Kisi Tommy ko. Outcome would've been the same... So let's hope we might be able to go with a Tommy if time comes.

People of KP and balochistan are happy that finally Punjab realized what's going on.

Now PTI is finished for sure 

Next govt will be bilawal under PDM but economy isn't going to recover..once Asim munir goes in 7-8 years we may see someone sane coming or Pakistan further going deep into crisis 

Ultimately it's possible the country might implode who knows
A break up isn't out of question several countries have broken up in the past due to mismanagement by the establishment be it USSR or Czechoslovakia or even old Pakistan


The next break up will probably split the country four ways balochistan Sindh Punjab and KP

There are no separatist sentiment in KP but PUNAJB/Sindh I feel the tension with PPPP and PMLN both being very strong local parties 

KP sentiment might change if IK is killed off which is very likely. KP sentiment is also getting worse due to security mis handling by military and it's toys (Taliban )
Kashmir/GB will be taken up by India

Yeah, I guess it's time he does what Hitler did after Berlin fell

&gt; But I must say, Khan tried very very very hard, it is just that this nation is dead AF.

Here you seem to equate this to one person only (Khan). I don't see it that way.

This should be seen as to whether the people of Pakistan can reform (and fix) their
industrial-military complex running amok (including the corruption) or whether they
can not. I understand that some focus this on Imran Khan, but I don't think this is the
only way to look at it.
As we have it right now Pakistan is a de-facto military dictatorship rather than a 
democracy; it's in a worse state than India (and India has tons of problems too,
see an objective analysis on ethnic minority rights). Someone will have to fix the
issue of the military in Pakistan one day - even if Imran failed, the issue is not
going away "on its own". See Myanmar for when a country goes full bananas.

ہارتا وہ ہے جو ہار مان لیتا ہے

IK hasn't quit - the people shouldn't either

Only Faujeets and PDM'ers would want to spread despondency.

Doesn't matter. Always support the right side. As long as we do that, our job is done.

Where the heck is Imran Riaz Khan?

His whereabouts remain unknown… I hope he’s OK.

Being tortured

probably being tortured.

&amp;#x200B;

might end up dead or in a state close to that soon.

He's being tortured by our esteemed idaray because that's what they do best, abduct and torture people who expose their corruption. They also like to strip people naked and make videos of them, so they can blackmail them later.

We love our idaray, such benefit they are to the nation.

May God protect him

this is peak embarrassment and fascism, you can disagree with him politically but this brutality is just inexcusable. really sad state of affairs when anyone cam get "picked up" for mere crime of freedom of expression

You can't be sure about anyone's safety now.  
What more can they do after blatently arresting people on bogus charges.

Who knows. Either being tortured, or killed. You can expect the worst from these thugs.

He’s probably going to turn up dead as it seems he is the kind of person they can’t break

apparently speaking the truth isnt allowed in this country, look at Arshad Sharif, killed by lumber 1, LHC has been asking for his presence for the past week, still no sign of him, lumber 1 in reality is nothing but a papa ki princess with inflated ego

Where the hell is democracy, Being raped by a Hafiz?

where are the leftists, people party democracy lovers, pdm loyalists? how can anyone that wants to make this country better stay silent when people are getting abducted? 

it may not be you today but it will be your turn next if you don't realize what is happening. 

Get out of the media propaganda and see what a banana republic this country has become. 

No one in Pakistan has any rights. Except for lumber 1 of course.

Fauj se maar kha raha houga

The sinister statement of IG Punjab in Lahore Court that "uss ney khud ko ruposh kar liya hoga", is worrisome and alarming.

They killed Arshad Sharif ... They were unable to control Imran Riaz ... Baqi Sahir Shakir, Moeed Pirzada bahar nikal gaye. Pakistan is under a fascist regime since long. These goons were hiding behind their political puppets and pulling the strings. One thing that Khan has done is to strip these pigs naked. This is the end game now. Pakistan's economy is going down. Thats why they are trying their hardest to control. It is only a matter of time before awam explodes and eats them alive.

This is the state of lawlessness in Pakistan.  A senior journalist abducted by agencies, right outside court, no knowledge of his whereabouts, no charges, no process. Just law of the Jungle. And Shahbaz Sharif has the audacity to claim that all criminal acts and violations of law and order will be dealt with severely. What a sham!

Many people are saying that he is probably dead or in a very bad state. This is absolute fascism. He couldve easily bowed down and kissed their ring but he defied them. I hope this tyranny comes to an end. I hope these oppressors face the wrath of Allah and get punished.

They are presenting him in the court after Court order. I think he's not being tortured now but is in a condition that cannot be shown to the judge and public. I think he was tortured for the first days so bad that now they cannot present him to anyone. They are giving it time for him to recover. But it could well be that he died.

Funny thing is the whole international journalists have kept quite.

Don't think they will kill him. But torture? Expect the worst

being tortured in Lahore

BTW it took 5 years of similar situations for the Chileans to get rid of the dictator Augasto Pinochet . Protests against the military regime went on from 1982-83 to 1988. Now we have the internet. Should bring about the downfall faster.

I think they ended up accidentally killing him during a torture session

Gathering material for yt.

Exactly. And then the PDM supporters and army sympathizers wonder why no one like either of them. It’s in your face that people are being jailed, tortured , killed illegally And yet people have the audacity to say “wElL iK iS tHe SaMe…”

he did come up in my dreams...

given the fact that I have taken a break from Pakistan's politics due to its ruthless environment...

Police don't know and according to them he might be in hiding. They asked Lahore High court to inquire about his whereabouts from agencies and LHC panicked.

They know he was taken away from the jail, so why have they not arrested all of the staff who work at the jail for participating in kidnapping?

Army jail.

Han kya kaam hay? Jaldi bolo /s

Allah Imran bhai ki hifazat karay but the only clue I have is he is the kind of person who would never run away and he was actually running away when they caught him.

Since he has contacts and there are good people in the system, maybe someone tipped him that run because the worst is coming but unfortunately, he could not. :(

Not confirmed but some people (not the solider speaks guy)same he might be in a coma as he was struck on the head when being taken away by ISI form police

Those end level Dajjal must have killed him and now they are planning what stupid reason to give JUST LIKE ARSHAD SHARIF

Baki Allah kher kre sometimes it feels like qayamat whatever is going on

Those goons will not kill irk but they will never release him. They want to spread fear to all journalists community. They admitted they mishandled Arshad shareef. They are power when they keep the person in prisoned.
Shame on them. Day of judgement Mai Allah poochay

What i believe is he is being tortured and cannot bring him to court in this state because the court will ask questions and they don't have a reason to arrest him. Likely IG Punjab said he is not wanted by the police. In case he's dead it'll create another scene in the country and he must've kept some secrets to be released after something happens to him. Maybe they're looking for that data to destroy it first and then will release him.

Paki Tucker Carlson, [where are you???](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=776rvGHfzuM&amp;t=6s&amp;ab_channel=Gattikus)

The sad thing is and I’m not surprised due to their allegiance to PDM etc but journalists like Hamid Mir who will advertise he has bullets in his body at any given chance and claim to be victims of such torture by the State are very quiet regarding the whereabouts of their fellow journalists.

Acc. To the reports, he's in coma. :|

Bus zinda ho, warna bad scene hai. Good guy good jurno. Hope he is fine.

hopefully still alive

People of Pakistan have stormed GHQ the Army Head Quarter in Pakistan to protest against illegal kidnapping of Imran khan by paramilitary forces in Court premises.



How are they being allowed to enter so easily? We all know that if the army wants to stop something, they rest at nothing.

People should go inside and see the houses and luxury of the army. Technically its all paid by the people so the people deserve to see what is inside the iron gates.

[ Removed by Reddit ]

wanna hear u/warhea's take on this!

Fucking great!

Doesn’t make sense, only  Begairat Insaan and terrorists are allowed to enter GHQ.

MASHALLAH

blkul khali haai ya t9 kuch loocha hai.🤣

These are made from taxpayers money. We will have to pay to fix them. 

Apne pair par kulhari marna

They should attack the FFC office across the road.

May allah keep these people safe

One world government incoming

There really isn't a Pakistan without Imran Khan, I'll be applying for immigration to Canada inshallah

What's left is PDM which means we're just Sindhi (PPP) Punjabi Shia Sunni Deobandi (JUIF, SSP) Barelvi (TLP) etc. Each province fighting to get on top.

Imran Khan was the only one who had the hearts of a cross section of society. And despite the propaganda about him dividing the country, he was the only one who united.

Karachi specifically will be even more hopeless, at least in Punjab there's khata hai tou lagata hai. Establishment has already put Karachi as the first sacrificial lamb to pave the way for Project Bilawal by gerrymandering the district borders and miscounting and all the other rigging methods to ensure ethnofascist PPP either wins or gets more seats.

Pakistan’s army will be here to rule over the ashes.

Lumber 1 should just arrange a royal rumble, throw all these politicians into the ring, the winner gets 5 years

Lol, in a decade, Canada will be all Rajesh and Prem Gupta. 

The way Canada is being operated , it's no different than Pakistan, where politicians have no clue how to run the country. Where things are becoming unaffordable for existing citizens. Health care is slowly getting privatized, and education will be next. 

Canada also has its very own land mafia and money laundering schemes that are making housing an expensive endeavor for many Canadians. 

If you have lots of money and can buy small house on cash, you can live like a king on $2,500 a month, but if you don't have money then be ready to struggle unless you have technical skills like coding or something and make $100,000 plus. 

The only difference is that you don't have to bribe people to get justice or get a gas connection and stuff.

The type of crowd Canada is bringing in for the sake immigration will make you raise questions on how safe the country will be. What Canada needs is educated people who can speak English and work menial jobs without saying anything.

Maulana Azad was right, Jinnah was wrong. Just accept it and move onto Canada. Pak Fauj Zindabad.

Isn't that exactly what you should not be doing? Canada doesn't need you. Pakistan does.

In punjab khata ha to lagata b ha?

This must be a misunderstanding. They only care about Lahore division and do  some foolish works like building roads ( so they can get some haram ka paisa) .

Rest of the Punjab is not getting a similar treatment.

The fact that y’all would leave your own homeland instead of fighting for it is crazy. You will never feel belonging anywhere else because at the end of the day you will always be a Pakistani, or “an other” l, in any country you go.

Bro try to go to America or Australia. Go to Canada as a last resort.

Subhan’Allah - welcoming you to Canada when you make the move Insha’Allah! Amazing Pakistani diaspora and Muslim community that are economically thriving, politically vocal and closely knit Alhumdulillah. 

Although home prices and cost of living has gotten exorbitant and beyond expensive, better than living in Pakistan and being forced to by everything from PAK Fauj and their incompetently managed companies who’s profits will help the Generals buy property in Dubai.

Welcome!

Men, women &amp; children are out on the streets of Lahore at 3am, to welcome Imran Khan.



Imran Khan has reached Zaman Park.

honestly i get so nervous when awam is behaving like this in front of vehicles. it's such a big security risk.

welcoming immi chan at 3am ft. cops [boys in shambles]

Question regarding the police escort, give all the tension how is there a police escort with him? Is the security his private security, in which case are they allowed to use official sirens?

Honestly, if I was held hostage for 2 days, I'd just wanna get home.

He deserves that welcome, the way they abducted him from the court.

This is basically Jinnah level welcome and recognition. Azadi Azadi Azadiiii from establishments, self serving traitors of this country!!

This does bring a smile to me face

Imran khan🫡💐❤️🙏

Imran khan Zindabad

The trouble and headache this guy has single-handedly (along with public support of course) brought to the boys in one year alone has never been done since the partition.

Weekend hai, awake at 3am is normal.

Lmao. Boiz n Govt are only helping him.

I just don't get it, IK is nothing short of Khumaini of Pakistan. Why doesn't  he call for massive upheaval to topple the government.

This is what happens when there are no jobs

Donald Trump would receive a similar welcome.

What a bunch of donuts

Mehrbani inki kay kuch aur nai jala diya for the ideological height of 'My immi'.

Raja Riaz, a Parlimentarian has called for the public execution of Imran Khan. PDM is a fascist regime that must fall!



Imagine being so handsome your opponents call it a weapon

Immi have seriously toxic ex-friends

I lost a bunch of brain cells in trying to understand his logic. Calling him a Yahoodi? I mean, isn't that supposed to be a religion?

And just realised, he was with Imran in Pti. What a terrible choice

the same yahoodi you were licking for a ticket some time ago? the entire NA is nothing but a joke at this point

Kuch nahi ho ga. As long as they have Munir's backing ye isi taran bhonktay rahain gay.

Faisalabad also gave us Rana Sanaullah! Truly the factory for model Pakistanis!

اس بچارے کا آخری دور چل رہا ہے ۔
برداشت کر لو ۔
پی ڈی ایم والے بھی کر ہی رہے ہیں 😆

Raja Riaz showing the worst sides of Faisalabad, the other one being Rana Sana 😓😓

What a low life what a pathetic person and so low choice of words and sentences such an illiterate goon full paindu with no moral values daammmmmn i cant beat this.

Goons like this are not fit to represent the country at any level.

Opposition in NA 🤡. Riaz sahab phir aap 2022 tak kaafir ke saath the? Astaghfirullah! 

Ngl this also shows how idiotic Khan sahab's decision of leaving NA has been.

Bhai ham Faisalabadiyo ne ni paida kia is lotay ko. Khud he Haram khor Nikal Aya maa k pait se. Hsm ne to Rana Sana ko uski apni constituency se larne ni dia election.

FaisalaBad Manchester of Pakistan ? Kill me

All American Funded Parties Making Pakistan "Blocked". "All Parties"

The best thing the public can do is vote them out of their seat.

Side note pakistan and their love of public executions trumps any logic. Aese public executions ka kehte hain jese zameen janat ban jaye gi.

He knows a lot more about other people's daughter.. in per nazar rakhay koi

Shameless goons!!

Yaar yeh riaz saab sae koi ponchae app issi Yahoodi ki Govt mein thae matlab yaar bhot Begharat politicians hain Pakistan mein magar saab this guy is class apart

That's the kind of vermin IK collected.

And thats why I say Pakistan needs to get rid of Islam on a state level and in its politics. Jou dil chahe doosre ko yahoodi bolke phaansi ka order de deta hai. Also, diesel jaisay maulvis bhi paida hote hain. And dont forget Imran khan and his 'islamic touches'

Imran Khan uses the same sort of language, anal rape threats to political opponents, "unn ki cheekhaein niklain gi" and his followers lap it up.

So PTI's head of the parliamentary committee is calling for the execution of PTI's chairman 😂 Ghr ki larai hy.

Given the whole fiasco around the Punjab assembly CM election and PMLQ votes, we know that PTI supporters believe the head of the partliamantry committee (not the chairman) is the true representative of the party. 😂

Morons with no tact

I can't believe the amount of extreme dumb wits who can not understand the simple sentence OP wrote, just because He used Imran khan's name and Prophet Muhammad's name in same sentence doesn't make it a comparison you twats. Take your sorry little brains back to English classes and stop wasting your and others' time here.

Core Commander Lahore House has been set on Fire by Protesters against the illegal Kidnapping of Imran Khan



Corps Commander NOT Core Commander.

Hello martial law

It’s only gonna get worse...

This seems pre-planned. Wardi disguised as PTI workers. Delayed Elections are inevitable now.

Good, unfortunately we need the violence and it needs to be directed at folks who have committed violence against the working people of Pakistan for its entire history

Bet none of the people involved in this ever paid a single rupee in tax.

Yeah great..
This will make Pakistan great... 
PTI is trying to fix Pakistan the same way TTP tried to implement Islam...

Now destruction of public properties totally acceptable because it is IK and PTI

🚨 Imran Khan issues video statement claiming the authorities are not allowing his release. He says he’s been “kidnapped.” Calls on his supporters to get ready for protests.



As Imran Khan makes his way back home, he has shared yet another video message en route: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/13fsmwy/imran\_khans\_message\_as\_he\_travels\_to\_his\_home\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/13fsmwy/imran_khans_message_as_he_travels_to_his_home_in/)

Are they fucking stupid

Are they stupid as shit. Generals r still thinking it's the 80 and 90s.
Their ass is going to be kicked by the social media. In 5-10 years establishment will be no more IA

WTF is this bullshit? What's even the damn point of courts anymore? Jsut shut down all this drama and call yourself kings and queen and be done with it.

FFS. These utter shitheads are gonna suffer. How have they not learnt any lesson? Has awam not had enough bullshit for the last few days? Do we really need more chaos?

I heard that IG offered Imran to go with him. They were for some reason not agreeing to let him go on his own.

Bro what is this khulli fucking badmashi ? Is there any respect for rule and law in the eyes of the Na-Pak Army ?

I worry that he will get another assassination attempt, and the government/military can claim that's why they weren't letting him leave. Of course, they actually want this attempt to be successful.

Are they drunk on power or whiskey? stupid Hafiz thinks he is a king.

Can anybody kindly help translate the second half? My urdu skills are poor

Establishment has lost its mind completely what were they expecting arresting him illegally that people would sit ideal and do nothing like come on.

This was really really irresponsible in retrospect.

Burn it down.

On a side note Imran Khan wanted everyone to go to jail to protest. Why so much cry when he actually ends up in jail himself.

**Why does he advice ordinary PTI supporters something that is so painful for him.**

He's been kiddnapped but is allowed to make videos? Wake up Pakistan.

He looks like such a shaky possum without those sunglasses. I can see why he feels the need to wear them in public appearances. 

This Islamofascist cuck loses his sturdy demeanor the moment he experiences an iota of the feeling that Pakistani minorities go through on the daily. He got off easy, tbh.

So now the complete London plan is out. Using pretext of violence while I was inside the jail, they have assumed the role of judge, jury and executioner. Then will follow complete crack down on whatever is left of PTI leadership and workers. Finally they will ban the largest &amp; only federal party.

It's all in Bandial's hands now

Wow. I sense establishment and PDM are genuinely going to do something very dangerous now in desperation.

What a joke of a Country. Complete and deliberate abject failure.

I really hope bandial puts his phone on silent, or else Dirty Harry and lumber 1 aint letting him sleep

So this is what law of the jungle looks like.  Where's the hunter with the gun to keep the jackals and hyenas out?

And [remember, O Muḥammad], when those who disbelieved plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you [from Makkah]. But they plan, and Allāh plans. And Allāh is the best of planners.(8:30)

Inko kab aram milay ga 😭

Very heavy heart today. May Allah keep khan &amp; Pakistan in His protection amen

We need a revolution now , a rebirth of all institutions and maybe a new system , democracy with a British parliamentary system doesn’t seem to work for Pakistan , we need to try some other method of governance , maybe socialist or nationalist in ideology , and if they are resorting to physical violence , we are not sheep waiting to be culled, the Pashtuns and Baluch have always had their guns in their arms and have been ready to sacrifice themselves for the motherland , the other groups especially punjabis need to grow a spine and openly oppose the dynasties , put zardari’s head  on a platter , put sharif’s head on a platter , kill all these Vermins , start with new blood

They don't have to ban anyone on pretext of some grand Plan. PTI leadership and workers took an axe and hit themselves in the foot with it by going out and glorifying violence. What's with IK blaming everything on everyone else but never taking responsibility for actions? 

It's the payback time. Of course all those who instigated violence and glorified should pay back.

Aurat March’s Selective Activism is Shameful!



Its sad because the morons representing them involving them selves in politics has trashed the image of the whole movement.

Aurat March literally gets funding from west to cause discord in Pakistan. The western world has been doing trips all over Africa promoting“social equality and LGBT rights” while countries like France are still stealing their resources. It’s crazy but it has worked and it’s brainwashed so many people around the world. If it were up to them, Pakistan would get transgender bathrooms before women and children stop facing hunger.

If only it was a real "Aurat March" their agenda is mainly to promote LGVTQ community, they've got nothing to do with women.

Waisay bhi March me hi active hoti hai wo abhi May hai garmi bhi bht hai

I mean it was pretty previous a long whole ago Aurat March became a political tool.

I think Pakistanis are way too naive and uneducated to be unable to see thsse hidden agendas by these obscure groups

Did PTI speak up for Aurat March when their protestors were being harassed and had police threw stones at them? 

It works both ways.

The thing I dont like about such posts is that misogynists will use it to paint the whole feminist movement in a negative light.

It was pretty disappointing statement. A whole paragraph on just Imran khan which wasn't even true.

Unfortunately book is judged by its cover, the face of this march is long been tainted now.

I hope no one shows up to the fake march when it happens.

Journalists missing for a week, at least 50 dead in a day with plenty of video evidence. Multitude of insane arrests and videos of PTI people getting dragged away.

Women and children being manhandled and beaten by police.

Even a damn 1965 Air Commodore with serious combat experience basically being the second best of his entire pilot class being shoved around like some degenerate.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only does international media barley care, they didn't even report or bother to update the total death toll count.

&amp;#x200B;

But they'll be there every year to cover Aurat March and the cool 50 million the USA gives for "gender equality" so they can continue to fund their CIA General Store Outpost.

&amp;#x200B;

I still remember when this march started and it was such a good idea that immediately became a random political affiliation because everything in this country is destined to be corrupted.

I get what you're trying to say and I do somewhat agree with you but this meme doesn't make sense.

OP is furthering an agenda with false info. Rebutted in a the threads.

This thread is downvoted because of the mindset "I should support this movement because I am a woman" without any critical thinking.

Aurat march organizers are pawns.

Being "dragged, assaulted,  harassed" at a protest (much in the same way that guys were) isn't a gendered issue, so there's no reason for a group who's focus is on gender rights to condemn it.

Contrast that with issues such as acid attacks or honor killings. Both are gendered issues that women in Pakistan face because our society ties a woman's value to the "honor" she brings her family. If she negatively impacts that honor, she gets killed or acid thrown in her face. Therefore, it makes sense for Aurat March to condemn this practice.

Edit: Turns out the OP post was misleading. Open the thread to learn why.

There are women here with legitimate grievances and Aurat March is just a gaggle of elite coconuts that want to show their angrez friends how enlightened, angrez and girlboss they are.  They’re the desi female version of western male neckbeards but way more annoying (at least neckbeards are too lazy to leave their mother’s basement).  I’ve seen some of their posts on Twitter and Facebook and all I can think to myself is “have you even left your home???”  They’re so out of touch with how life is for the average lower class woman (or man for that matter, the lives of normal people here absolutely suck).  Even as a poor American they live so much better than I did (14 hours a day on my feet for low pay and even with a military disability pension that’s still barely paying the bills).  I’ll be honest, I have it much better here than the average person and a much easier life than I did in the US just from my pension alone, but I don’t even have a car or my own home.  All my savings are going to pay for Hajj probably 10 years from now.  

Then these chicks come out with their pro-kufr slogans and misdirected anger over shit they don’t actually have to deal with and I can’t even physically roll my eyes to the level of eye roll they deserve (and most likely arrived at the protest in the back of their dad’s Mercedes driven by a driver who the family treats like a slave).  They don’t care about women being force married, being treated like maids by their in-laws, domestic violence etc.  it’s all about elevating themselves up so they don’t feel like a bunch of brown savages they consider everyone else who doesn’t live in their society.  They deserve all the hate they get and more.

But this happened before after Aurat march, are you saying Women's right movement in Pakistan is own by PPP because Imran khan said it's women fault if she got assaulted and PPP protested against that statement while Imran Khan was busy with his nonsense PPP was working for women and now when PTI female workers are assaulted PPP should raise voice against them , makes sense.

Not true

KPK policemen are allegedly resigning



Good if it's true the more the scum at the top loses control over the grunts the better  


regular policemen and soldiers likewise realise that they are getting screwed over by the system for a bunch of scummy kleptocrats  


It's only the idea of discipline and "following orders" that gives those beghairats power and the moment large scale desertions start happening they will be completely powerless

More backbone than our entire army and police put together.

🤦🏽‍♂️ this is an old training exercise video!

Massive props to them if true. Putting themselves in a tough situation to do what is right.

Doubt its true as nice as it would be. Wouldn’t make much difference since they will just dress army guys in police uniforms etc

Lmao. 
New recruits, probably in a training camp.

I hope someone from Top military brass gets shot by their guards.

Shoot at sight will be sooner than earlier

At this point all countries police and bottom level soldiers should do same

Provincial police are basically political thugs. Of course they will listen to their masters.

First it was Munity in the Army and now this? These days nothing can be outright believed.

Respect!

regardless of whether this is true or not

aik baat to such hai

AMREEKA NE KUTTAY PAALAY

ARMY WALAY, ARMY WALAY

Pathans are truly ghairatmand quam ...

Whether you like him or not, props to IK for this

I think at this point, with social media and everything, it was a prefect time to start criticising Pak fauj again. Imran Khan has taken it to next level with directly pointing fingers at the people on the top.

PTI supporters currently do not give a flying fuck if they get kidnapped or not, they’ll still criticise and even bash the army, rightfully so. Establishment is the biggest mafia and the biggest problem we face to today.

Maybe tomorrow someone else will be against the army, but because of Imran Khan, they’ll also have the balls to criticise the fauj extensively because someone else (Ik) has already done it. I think this is an extremely good development.

Pti supporters need to be careful and start dressing alike and wearing masks and have good alibis. Terrorism charges are not fun and if they are turned in and Imran Khan doesn't win , then they will be forgotten in jails.

I don't think Imran Khan will win this battle against Asim Muneer. I know the PTI supporters will hate me for this, but I don't see a way out for him. One man can't end the dominance of the military establishment that's been ruling us for about 70 years. I believe he's not looking to end the dominance of the military but is trying to get them on their side like they were in 2018.

After Asim Muneer, the Pakistan army will always have successors that have the same ambition and power. After Imran Khan, I don't think anyone will come up that has the amount of influence as he does. After Imran Khan, PTI will either die or it's leaders will become the puppets of the Establishment once again. 

I hope I'm wrong tho. Whether it's Nawaz Shariff or Benazir Bhutto, nobody has given a tough time to these Generals like Khan did. If he's genuinely trying to bring change and to not just get the army on his side(which I think he's trying to), then God be with him.

I respectfully disagree as I'm old enough to remember the 80s and BB. The resistance then was perhaps stronger but the establishment was stronger.

Maybe IK however has a better chance as he is nationally more powerful and the establishment is weaker than those days.

I wish our economy was much more stable, the fact that we’re heading towards possible default and all this drama at the same time, I’m not quite sure where this country is headed.

NAPAK.  Fauj can not put genie back in bottle no matter how people they kill or torture.

Imran Khan will not back down, neither corrupt army will stop.
Soon IK will be killed or jailed for long time. But he will not go down without a fight. Ik knows on day of judgment when Allah will ask what did you do with fame and power. He will have solid answers.
Pdm and army on the other hand have enjoyed this world and might continue to enjoy it, but their afterlife is ruined. Doing wrong and then doing umrah is sick mentalities most power full people do.
We won't see corrupt mafia suffering in this world but rest assured what they did to Pakistan,  Allah will ask them.
I MY EYES IMRAN KHAN DID WHAT HE COULD DO ALONE. ITS ONE AGAINST JUST TOO MANY. I HOPE ALLAHS MIRACLE BUT REALITIY RIGHT NOW IS NOT LOOKING GOOD.
make bilawal next pm of all I care now

Only way it changes is if the people on the inside turn aswell.

People needs to be optimistic. Generals and their puppet PDM’s every plan has failed so far. They are humiliated. People now know that these holy cows Pak Fauj Generals are main culprits. Bhuttos, Sharifs, Maulana, Zardari are their face savers.

I like IK somewhat though I hate his party and associates. He is a man of contradictions. He might himself be honest and all but his associates (MNA, MPA, senior leaders in PTI) are all ex-PDM.

He is basically leading a rebranded PDM.

Let's hope things turn out for the best but I have very few hopes.

As long as he doesn’t switch to “Army good” once the deal is made. But I doubt it might happen. If the result of all of this is the end of Establishment’s involvement then that will be great but I am not optimistic. Hope to be proven wrong

This will only end once politicians stop becoming establishment boot polishers again and again, it will not come from a revolution but a serious introspection at Pakistani politics and society.

Y'all are really acting like Nawaz Sharif hasn't openly called out the army in the past. Heck he called out Bajwa by name. Anti military sentiment isn't new, PTI and Khan didn't invent it, and you can bet your bottom dollar that as soon as he is back in power, this energy will go away as if it never existed.

IK is 70% popular in Pakistan according to RepublicPolicy.com

IK used RepublicPolicy.com poll to he is famous

A simple WhoIs query show that this domain was created on 2022-10-08. About 6 months ago.

Almost all content on the website is plagiarized. I searched text from random articles and they show up “as is” on other websites.

I am surprise as why IK has to show poll result from a fake website in his recent live appearance?

Saad rizvi more than PPP💀

These surveys are bs. There's been a Gallup survey too. I never believe in them. Can't even generate a decent sample size that's representative of the population.

Having said that everyone knows his popularity is all time high. No one is close.

Someone guiding him wrong. He could have easily used the Gallup survey which everyone believes in, even if it was a little old.

Lol 18% is too much…

Also, it says Punjab, not Pakistan.

Agreed. Real number would be higher but anyone who publishes it, will be arrested.

Survey done by PTI backed organization . Must be authentic.

You lied so much that start believing your own lies

Imran Khan win or loose, man this guy has become the biggest leader in Pakistan after the founders. kudos to his legacy.

I really do believe his populairty is atleast 90% at this moment.

In 2018 IK won 50% of the seats in Punjab so you can roughly correlate that to 50% popularity. 

So to say that he's had a 20% increase in popularity  today versus in 2018 is not that far off; it seems pretty accurate. This is the most popular he has ever been in his political life, I wouldnt be surprised if its higher.

You don't need these surveys to gauge his popularity among the masses. The by-elections after his ouster for both the PA and NA and the fact that the government is hesitating so much to conduct the elections clearly indicate his popularity.

What about Pindi Boys? I’m sure if they were considered it would be **99% Popularity for Pindi Boys** and **1% Popularity for the BLACK VIGO** in which the surveyor came to take the Poll.

More daunting is that Saad Rizvi is 5% populous figure in Pakistan. Another Zia-influenced headache is waiting to burst in near future.

the fact that saad rizwi got 5 percent scares me

That's what the establishment fears: that popularity will lead to them losing their stolen assets. They have been doing these shenanigans since decades. It's time to reform the military from the grounds up, until they are working for the people rather than beating up the people.

RepublicPolicy.com  
Creation Date: 2022-10-08

ZAFAR IQBAL - CEO (Marketing Practitioner)

The CEO is a Marketing Practitioner and I must admit he played a viral stunt publishing that ~~fake~~ survery.

The website was created just last year. Operates somewhere from Islamabad, Pakistan.

Who are these people and what's the authenticity of anything published on that website?

Who voted for Saad Rizvi? 🥺

Ik is irrelevant the question is how will establishment put bilawal into power of they are doing worse then the D team TLP.

You see? If we don’t get him ourselves out he will die

If we don’t get him ourselves out he will die

It's partially true at least. He, himself, mentioned in the court he hasn't gone to washroom in a day and ask to be allowed access to his doctor - severely dehydrated of course.

And the high fever and leg pain isn't something hidden - PIMS report mentioned it yesterday. Hit someone on the unhealed injuries and there might be internal bleeding or an infection, if nothing just inflammation.

Khans death will drive the country into a whirlwind of violence and chaos

Nothing is ever achieved by peaceful protest’s unfortunately . History is witness.

Sounds like a trap!!! They are already gearing up to class PTI as a terrorist org!

Source? Sounds BS

Meanwhile my father right now "Nasha nahi mil raha is lie doree par rahe hai" lol 😂

Ps. I don't actually believe that I mean there's no way to know, just find it hilarious

Burn it all to the ground

Thanks for banning me mods

Yar please easy ho jao this is not a movie or something, they cannot straight up kill him in there. Stop spreading mass hysteria

The plan is to never give up,it's  now or never.

Provide water for the people in the streets.

He's such a narcissist, even after death he wants to play politics! Already saying "they will kill me", sucha coward and bate sunlo iski.

would be better if he died tbh   
always had a big mouth and didnt bring anything but ruin to the country

The messiah concept can never work inside a country like Pakistan.

Before the PTI supporters label me a PML-N supporter or PML-N supporters label me a PTI supporter or any one of you label me a Boot-Polishiya, I would like to state the disclaimer that I am indeed neutral in its truest sense; I don't side with any party or institution.

I would, however, like to state my opinion that this whole "Only Imran can save Pakistan" mentality is doomed to fail. Why? Easy. Just eliminate him, and there will be no one left after him to take up his mantle. The rest of his party members are merely career politicians that are known to be opportunistic lotas. They mostly hail from the same segment of society that is divorced from the struggles of the common man. History has proven again and again that movements led by a leader are rarely successful. Latin America is a perfect example of that. Ernesto Guevara tried to jolt up the Bolivian public to take up arms against its American-back corrupt government. Instead, the Bolivians betrayed the very man that was trying to put some sense into them, because Bolivians were cowardly and intellectually suppressed people at that time.

Assuming if Imran indeed manages to come into power, and that is a big IF, the rest of the nation is still generally morally corrupt. Our ethical and moral decadence is not just restricted to the upper echelons of society. A stall owner selling fruits resorts to corruption. Is it the fault of the army generals? People performing government jobs, is their lack of responsibility and sincerity to the job the fault of the generals or politicians? I have work colleagues that break the lockers of other people at my workplace and steal their personal belongings. Is this too due to a Yehudi conspiracy? We lie and cheat each other on a daily basis. Is this the fault of the government?

I remember back when Imran Khan's government was in power, a new airline was established in Pakistan. I was hired for a post I was overqualified for because the management personnel told me that the owners have ordered that only graduates from Sialkot will be hired for positions requiring a graduate degree; most of them were relatives of the Sialkoti owners. Is this blatant disregard of merit and shameless display of nepotism a fault of Amreeka Bahadur? Where were Imran Khan's ideals then?

We focus obsessively on sunnah on matters pertaining to "aurat ki shalwaar" and "mard ki talwaar". But have we ever stopped to focus on the fard and sunnah encouraging mercy and social wellbeing? We whine about lack of mercy and generosity in our society, but have we ever even stopped to rescue an injured kitten/puppy in the streets, let alone a human being?

Let's face it: This whole "Imran Khan is the only savior of Pakistan" manjan is also a product of the establishment's many machinations. They are now simply trying to sell the gullible people of Pakistan a new plot, albeit failing at it.

The moral of the story is that we are a nation of morally decadent, sexually perverted, and intellectually retarded people divided into religious and ethnic sects. Leaders don't create successful nations. Nations create powerful leaders. Should there arise a need to raise up arms against the establishment's tyranny, most of you keyboard warriors will run off to your safe enclaves in DHA and Bahria.

So, please, stop fooling yourself that Imran will save Pakistan. This is a nation of doomed people. Heck, calling us a nation is a disservice to the word Nation.

You can feel free to disagree with me, but you know deep down inside that whatever I said is indeed correct to a lesser or greater level.

Neutrality in a time of fascism and oppression is not neutrality. It's siding with the fascists. Remaining neutral in times like this only empowers the aggressor/powerful. So I don't understand this cognitively dissonant stance a lot of Pakistanis are engulfed in.

Collective change requires collective involvement, but it's human nature to be drawn to singular leaders. It's why we remember individuals whose contributions have improved humanity, and why individuals often become the faces of movements. It is easier for people to unite behind a person or a small group of people that represent a shared ideology than to unite only behind the ideology. 

&gt;I would like to state the disclaimer that I am indeed neutral in its truest sense; I don't side with any party or institution.

Apathy and faux-neutrality are terrible characteristics. At least everyone else believes in something.

Return of the neutrals. I missed you guys. You never appear to question PDM but appear when questioning IK. Stick around this time.

lol Who said he was an Messiah? If anything PDM cultists call him that considering how much obsessed they are with him.

&gt; I would like to state the disclaimer that I am indeed neutral in its truest sense; I don't side with any party or institution.

loll.. :P 
&gt; I remember back when Imran Khan's government was in power, a new airline was established in Pakistan. I was hired for a post I was overqualified for because the management personnel told me that the owners have ordered that only graduates from Sialkot will be hired for positions requiring a graduate degree; most of them were relatives of the Sialkoti owners. Is this blatant disregard of merit and shameless display of nepotism a fault of Amreeka Bahadur? Where were Imran Khan's ideals then?

Wait... so private company does nepotism/whatever random .... therefore, IK bad? 

&gt; So, please, stop fooling yourself that Imran will save Pakistan. This is a nation of doomed people. Heck, calling us a nation is a disservice to the word Nation.

Chalo. Great. Agreed. you're absolutely right. 

Now what? Should i just go home and starve while groceries sky-rocket? Do I not deserve even elections? Is that so much to ask? That's the only reason why I support PTI. They are asking for democracy, for elections.

&gt; You can feel free to disagree with me, but you know deep down inside that whatever I said is indeed correct to a lesser or greater level.

and what's your part in this? you took that job and enjoyed the money? Where's your morals? Should you not have immediately resigned? Are you wanting and fighting for elections? for democracy? 

bruh... I don't get you "neutrals" .. You're entire motto is "Let's stay at home and ignore the fire around this nation". Seriously? The nation is burning down. A lot of us live here, and don't get jobs by nepotism like you. Internet shutting down destroys my earnings completely. Constant increase in dollar rate and expenses and inflation isn't helping me. I cannot just sit down and ignore the fires in my nation.

These people don't learn, they don't think with their brains and they are just facing the consequences of their decisions. We are just the passengers of this sinking ship, let's play the violin while it goes deeper into the abyss. :)

I think this whole "messiah" narrative is the most annoying thing in all of this. Was Nelson Mandela a messiah? was Gandhi or Quaid-e-Azam a Messiah? Anyone, who the majority of people consider a leader = Messiah? IK is today's leader just like those before him were the leaders of their time. Someday he'll be buried and a new "Messiah" will take his place. Or are you saying that people just shouldn't hope and descend to complete anarchy? because that is how civilized societies are made? 

And the most important question is, what good are you doing by making this argument? do you want us to just say, "ok IK is being treated like a messiah so ill just ignore everything else"? and then what? do I teleport to another alternate Pakistan where democracy is restored?

Im going to say one thing only. You started this post by saying it is wrong to believe "only Imran Khan can save Pakistan" and you ended it by saying "stop fooling youself that imran khan will save pakistan". It seems like your post started on one note and ended on another. Maybe thats the reason why people have felt like they needed to defend Imran khan instead of focusing on the concern you were raising. You should think about these things before blatantly calling people intellectually retarded because thats not how you create grounds for intellectual discussion with people that and mentally and emotionally under stress due to current situation. All this could have been avoided by simply saying           "Supporting imran khan might be a step in the right direction but the people themselves have to change for things to actually get better".

U know who are neutrals ? Animals

Our 50% population doesnt vote, u r from that party.
And if u try to look closely there are bunch of things that happend from 2018 to 2021. Sehat card was one of the best things about. If u disagree than sorry for u.

Kaptaan in the field now.

This tweet is just a tiny glimpse of the mountain of bullshit being launched at him and how easy it is for him to get rid of it.

I'm out of loop here. Cpt. Whiskey resigned fr?

The telegraph have just replicated a popular piece of gossip that has been circulating on social media since Asim Munir became COAS, without any proof or confirmation of this story.  No idea what the reality of the story is.

Ok. What was the real reason for Asim Munirs resignation?

Telegraph expects me to buy their subscription to read their BS lol.

These morons continue to show their incompetence. Dear PM alread tweeted about this too. A) Where is the official ISI motto or job description which says their job is to find corruption in the cases on a PM's wife? Again providing evidence they are morons and not neutrals. Is the ISI job to provide external intelligence and counter intelligence or find something on Bushra Bibi? Did they forget the memo to focus on Bibi (Israel) and focused on the wrong Bibi? B) where is the evidence now and why wasn't it used? C) So are we done with Ghari chor and Toshakana?

Wtf is going on in pakistan

This is UK newspaper. So let take them to court as he advised others in the past.

As Ik has exceptional track record to tell the truth

Phew! What a relief. Imran khan refutes the claim that he or his wife were involved in any corruption. No need to investigate any further. Just close the case already.

Bros going to call an internationally renowned media outlet “ conspirators” now, and his little cult will believe it 😂😂💀💀💀💀. Those PTI tiktok aunties will be hasty in labelling the telegraph and guardian sources ghaddars.

Chairman PTI Imran Khan has appealed Overseas Pakistanis to raise funds for the martyrs of May 9th



Link to donate: [https://www.gofundme.com/f/victims-of-police-brutality-and-torture](https://www.gofundme.com/f/victims-of-police-brutality-and-torture)

Well donating is the least I could but wish there was more I could do. Heartbroken by everything going on in Pakistan.

Going by previous appeals, he’ll get an overwhelming response from OSPs. Something Mr. Platelet and Mr. Backache can only wish and dream for.

Every 5 mins or so, someone donates 100$. One person donated $10,000.

PDM could never. اُن کو صرف لعنتیں اور جوتے مل سکتے ہیں

Dado charger is gonna cry Foreign Funding 😡\s

Donation is up to about 10 crore Rupees.

Thanks for sharing. OSPs will do their part inshAllah!

After the health card, the education card is to be started once PTI is back - Imran khan



Instead of subsidizing private schools. Change the face of the government schools that are already running, make them the standard so that even a kid from beacon house or Atchison has to ask their parents to get him to a government school because they are so good.

I wish this happens. Health card was such an amazing initiative. Ppl were really happy with the health card.

He is saying "ganday school" to government schools, &amp; "achay school" to private schools. 
If he can't convert government schools to more "acha school" than private school. Then this all is bullshit.

Before that we have to fix our education sector

Out with ratification in with critical thinking and problem solving

Bring in new books that actually are updated with their knowledge (looking at you computer books)

Allowing students to pick what medium of language they wanna study in

More emphasis on digitalization

Counseling kids

Teaching students about coding, editing and even hardware work

With how class and exclusivity is a selling point in Pakistan 

I doubt parents will be willing to allow their child to learn together with a child from a less fortunate background especially in the primary and secondary years of education 

A brilliant initiative but I think this would lead to more discriminatory institutions

Who comes up with these stupid ideas in PTI. I think it comes from right at the guy sitting at the top. WTF immychan? 

If you want to improve education, make governments schools better and fit for human habitations. Train teachers, distribute school lunches, improve books, buy computers, establish public libraries. 

Not come up with useless schemes like education card which subsidizes private schools at every corner to jack up their prices.
This idea only works with Sehat card, since hospitals don't sprout at every corner and it's harder to scam the government. This education card thing is a disaster idea.

Is this even feasible? I know that there are long-term economic benefits of investing in education but can the GOP afford to fund something like this?

Edit: Did some Googling and found out PTI has done something like this [before.](https://www.geo.tv/latest/440148-imran-khan-lauds-kp-government-for-insaf-taleem-card-project)

&gt;Through Insaf Taleem Card, around 244,000 students of government colleges will get free education.

They waived the fees of 240k students in Sep 2022.

The quality of education system here is alarming. So unless that gets fixed, don't expect great results for Pakistan in the future.

Not agree with khan though his intention is to benefit people.
Needs to improve government schools, not to subsidize private schools.

Rather than this, i recommend mr. Khan to open the libraries in every city or towns and put the latest books, journals &amp; magazines etc with minimal fees or membership. To educate the new generation, we need these kinda steps.

Update the stuff in books for each level  and should be the same all over Pakistan. Set a criteria for teachers even in remote areas.

How would this even work? Who would go to government schools? Will there be an limits? Health card gives you insurance for the one offs but schools are a constant thing. So the government will be paying for the high profit margins of these schools and running the government schools simultaneously? Everyone will go to Aitchison then. Whatever happened to SNC the whole point of it was to make it so that gov schools and madarssa come on par with private schools. It's like when producers see a movie that was a hit and they pour more money into it and overdo it and you end up with a shitty sequel this that.

All these unnecessary extra steps that will cost a lot and won't fix anything for the long term, just improve government school standards already.

At this point privatize all the responsibilities of government and then the government gives handouts from money they don't have to people so they can afford these marked up services.

I am sorry but if you really think about it, that's pretty much becoming PTI/PDM's policy now and their respective base just eats it up.

Hmm, it just sounds weird, but let's see. Sehat card is different, and it was feasible since it had a unique ID and isuanrance could be claimed. Need more information on how the education card will work. 

I think this is just subsidizing the schools. Instead of focusing on governemnt run schools, the government will subsidize private schools to help expand the network and get more kids access to schools.

I see some limitations, though. For instance, we can see class sizes increases. We could also see schools discriminating against these students.

Ideally, all children should be able to get admissions irrespective of their social and financial status. There shouldn't be a need to have an education card.

What is this education card I hope it is not similar to what Miftah Ismail was talking about.

What he needs to do if he ever gets in power is hold a massive roundup. And a big Fire pit. And throw every single corrupt politician into it.

Rather than providing subsidies to private schools, the focus should be on improving the existing government-run schools to the point where even students from prestigious institutions like Beacon House or Atchison would ask their parents to enroll them in a government school due to the high standards of education provided there.

Pehay kedru asan us time tay chalo current account ich kuch paya hoya sii..bas gallan kara lou... though it is a outstanding vision that is to make us self dependent just what our quaid wanted.. to study and get the best possible education which will make the country stand up even in difficult times.

I think sending low/mid class kids to high elite schools instead improving quality of govt schools is a really bad idea. Specially for kids own mental health.. Imagine the bullying from spoiled rich kids, poking funs at father/family financial status.. Then inferiority complex that a kid coming in big SUV while other kid coming in cd70.. It might spoil even that non-elite kid into forcing family to provide same facilities, badmouth at home for not providing enough, may even turn to illegal activities in future..

That's really unthoughtful ,problem will be reservation of seats for card holders which will always in scarcity as private schools dont want loss. So its better to develop public schools.

Health card should only be Given to the Poorest, I have seen People who own 2 Cars using Health Card

Subsiding is not good. Make people able to not be reliant upon subsidies. Education is already free till matric or FSC. The problem is education system is bad. It's literally just wasting your time. Improving it is the solution. 



Another big problem in Pakistan right now is food. Punjab used to supply the whole British India but now it can't even provide for Pakistan. Areas where there should have been agriculture are now DHAs. Fix that. 



Instead of shallow short term ideas focus on the future.

Lmao. What and who funds this? Fed government doesn’t generate any cash. Ye wali hakumat ikhata kary gi paisa, khud khaye gi, agli aye gi, khaye gi aur supposedly idhr udda de gi. Circle repeats.

Overseas Pakistanis rejoice with higher dollar, people in Pakistan suffer - but who cares. Toshakhana se cheezein cents mein uthao yashi kro. FTW.

Disaster in the making

Bro has no concept of money or economy. I am not against free education but look at us, we are already broke. We need a better economy, a better competitive economy that the world depends on then we can fund our needs but alas.

All talk bruh. Politics…

I'm still on the fence about this. On one hand, there are certainly benefits associated with providing quality education to people irrespective of their prior academic performance. On the other hand, it creates the risk of academic institutions compromising on the quality of teaching for the sake of making their curriculum more understandable to people with poor academic performance.

If PTI were to implement an education card initiative like this, they'd have to improve the teaching quality/curriculum across all institutions to maximize the benefits of this approach. But I'm not sure if we're equipped with the resources to pull this off in our current education system.

*Edit: If people are downvoting this reasoned comment, it really makes you wonder about the intelligence vs cultist devotional ratio of PTI supporters.*

Sure.

Also start universal basic income please 🥺

What is his plan to pay for it?

how about the quality of education, ratta education doesn't do anything. How about when they graduate, build industries so they have jobs? isn't that what most countries do? Always circling around the real problems and creating a placebo.

Imran Khan using the f word on a live broadcast when load shedding suddenly kicks in... Watch the first two minutes!



As a disclaimer I'm not anti IK, this was just a funny moment shared earlier on this sub but I couldn't find the actual stream as it was edited out.

Lol. Literally every Pakistani when the light goes out.

That's pretty much how any normal adult would react.

He's just like me fr

Why would anyone use disgusting 4-letter F word In Pakistan. Use of word Fauj should be banned Immediately.

Natural reaction that everyone in Pak can relate to. 
Just like Shadabs BC outburst during PSL. We felt that.

Ahaha, let’s imagine nawaz sharif speaking about building the state of medina and then said smth like this- what would be the reaction of all these youthis?

It’s only symbolic of his poor upbringing, the fact that he’s being praised for it and it’s increasing his popularity only goes to show how detrimental this man is for society collectively.

F* the both sides arguing about it like toddlers

Pakistan Considers Banning Imran Khan’s Party, Minister Says - Bloomberg



The only way they can do elections. Pathetic

The fact you can't face ik just speaks volumes on how hard you lost

The COAS is considering banning PTI. What a convenient way the international media waters down martial law when it benefits them.

Khawaja Asif is citing the May 9th events as the reason for it. Seriously? It gives the impression that they planned it to be a more significant event and will use it for this crackdown.

It’s an open secret now. PTI will be banned or suppressed down to the extent that no one would be able to contend under PTI. Still it doesn’t mean those leaders won’t be participating in elections. They’d shift parties or form a new party. Nothing changes for them.

COAS is doing everything to ban PTI. But Allah is the greatest and he should know that..

If you can't beat them in the elections then physically beat them until they fear for their lives and outlaw their party calling them terrorist. This government are chor and cowards.

 Shocking, it’s like finding out Fauj like to rape and torture Pakistani women.

Firoun also thought he had killed all the boys children in his kingdom and he was safe &amp; look what happened.

PTI getting curb stomped over peacock theft wasn't on my list of scenarios for 2023.

This is just a fear tactic, they don't got the balls.

Anyways my crazy conspiracy theory is that the Establishment's plan is to "neutralize" PTI with their favourite Pervaiz Elahi at the top and getting rid of pretty much anyone else by either have them in jail or leave the party.

You can’t ban a political party. Even if they move to ban it the courts will overturn it in an hour.

Pakistanis considers banning napak porn army.

What a shitshow!! Y’all should still vote! If and when they have election, go and vote. Draw a bat if you have to but vote.

Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan Discusses His Recent Arrest By Current Reg...

Looks pretty weak no matter how PTI folks play it. IK knew that US wasn’t behind his ouster. How f***ing hard it is to admit that my government was toppled because my Allie’s left me, simple but no Khan had to estrange Pakistan’s biggest export market partner. 
Now he is talking to the US because he knows that only US can put pressure on his antagonist aka the Army. 
Good luck with mental gymnastics guys

Yes amerikee sazish and Important government doing all these things , khan have build the narrative the Amerika is behind to topple his government and now begging amerikee media and government to give him justice.lol..

Imran Khan's message as he travels to his home in Lahore

I am glad he is safe may Allah keep him protected 🤲🏼

May allah protect you Khan saab ameen.

Guy needs to hit the bed fr

" Phir uski phatt gaye.... " and then khan sahab changed it to " uski pressure mein uss ne chora".. lolz.. May Allah bless you with long live and health.. Ameen

Looks tired AF. I am feeling sleepy just by watching him.

He shouldn't have announced it imo. Would have been better if he did this after reaching safely.

God Speed skipper. God speed!

Please post any updates, like when he gets back

I hope they dont plan on doing some stupid stuff on the M2

If something happens to him, I'll be done with pakistan, sadly.

So quick question. Where is he going in Lahore ? How does he know that the place he will be staying is not tampered with cameras, recorders, explosives etc..

Now standard Imran Khan threats be like: "main sab ko bataonga tumhara naam". XD

😍😍😍😎😎🤩🤩♥️♥️👏👏🥰🥰😘😘🫡🫡

Soon, is he actually free?

They'll kill him

🫡

Could it be they hid explosives in his Lahore home? I mean it rather sounds too good to be true that they are letting him go back. I am nervous. May forces of the universe and lady luck have mercy on this man.

Please tell his any single achievement in his 3.5yrs turn.im not against him.just asking for my knowledge.

A deep concern over the state sponsored and intelligence sanctioned abduction of the Journalist and commentator Imran Riaz Khan.

I don't know why this hasn't caused mass pandemonium and chaos in the media houses and journalist organizations in Pakistan regarding the illegal imprisonment of *Imran Riaz Khan*. I even believe that he might not be alive at this point in time. The power struggle between political factions is an unending reality in Pakistan, but targeted attacks on journalists demarcate a dangerous line. Where the incessant abuse of power propels it into suppressing free media. An event that may indicate the complete demise of any freedom of speech left. Although *Arshad Sharif's* killing should have been a good indicator of the extent of this sad reality, it could be understood that **IFJ** and other watchdogs for journalism haven't pushed Pakistan since it did not occur on its soil. What are your opinions regarding this, and do you think a remedy exists for this situation?

I think he was accidentally killed through excessive torture and now the people responsible are hoping this blows over or something.

I legit hope and pray my hypothesis is full of shit but I - like you - am fearing the worst.

No Pakistani citizen is safe under Na-PAk Fauj.

The sad reality is that for IFJ and other watchdogs he is just another statistics whereas for you this is selective outrage.

Others have been raising their voices against this brutality for a while where as people like imran riaz khan mocked them but now you see this as a banana republic.

Acknowledge the past and learn from your mistakes and stand with principals not the person even if it is a despicable person who does not support those principals.

not only local media houses I'm surprised it didn't make much of a splash in international media houses either considering the backlash after Jamal Khashoggi murder. a very prominent journalist just up and disappears and now we can't locate him apparently? I hope and pray for his safety and am hopeful that his case gets highlighted even more. its a very grim and depressing picture to know that even if you're influential and affluent you have no rights at all apparently.

Is that the guy who said Balochi civilians who were getting illegally abducted deserved it

SC orders to produce Imran Khan in the Supreme Court within 1 hour!

CJP ordered the former PM Imran Khan to be produced before the court within 1 hour! Seems like contempt proceeding might be initiated against NAB

If the verdict gets overturned (a very big IF), that does speak volumes of IHC CJ and his biased decisions against PTI

I have high hopes 
Sc also said imran khan ll be presented alone without any other pti official so something is fishy.also 
Bitches of the riches. So always expect worse.

Lanti judges aaj 3rd day bakwas kar rha ha. Pehlay kidr the yeh? Aaj hi news daikhi inhon nai? Jabh IK ko power sai hataya tabh to raat ko 1 bjay bhi baithay thay.

Very bad choice of words 🤣🤣🤣

1 hour passed. Any news?

Edit: spelling

He will get arrested again out of SC in more serious case :-)

Same cjp who laughed when heard about the arrest saying they can arrest from court room too hehe?

Good move but a bit late

If you guys believe courts are all compromised, why do you guys have hope in first place? Same goes for elections. Why bother with elections when you are not going to accept the results when you lose?

Bandial is a joke, bought and paid for by PTI. “The sanctity of muh courts” shut up, you don’t care about that when Imran spits on court rulings and incites mobs to resist rightful arrests. 

CJP got his panties in a wad about where IK was arrested while his trash supporters burn the country to the ground. Corrupt mf’er, he needs to be gone

Refer to the high court , something is definitely fishy.

Its been 4 hours. Where is IK?

Why isn't there a lawyer's movement happening right now?

The constitution has been completely violated. People are being abducted (not arrested). The orders of the courts of the country are being completely ignored. As soon as the court is granting bail, the police is immediately abducting people again. There are people who were nothing but peaceful that have been put into jails. The suppressed media is spouting non-stop that May 9 is a black day because a building burned but what actually led to that? What led to that was the sanctity of the high court being violated where Imran Khan was illegally abducted, equipment was destroyed, and high court staff were injured. 25 people innocent people have been killed, hunderds are injured with bullet wounds, and thousands are in illegal detention - but there's no one talking about that. We're more concerned about a building being burned when a lot worse has happened after Benazir was assassinated. Where are the lawyers?

I cant become a freedom fighter  if its gonna cost me my young daughter or wife or mother.
Its not easy to fight when enemy so close that they can hear you breath even.

Jibran nasir and other lawyers signed a petition and lawsuit for uninformed shutdown of the internet

Lawyers know the constitution belong to the highest bidder or the one with most guns, in case of Fauj it’s both.

Cuz we don't have Saul Goodman.

Showbaz bought them off with 2 swimming pools.

Unfortunately Pakistan is in full 1984 mode. But desperation can lead to drastic measures by the people and popular unrest will be difficult to control.

If you’re thinking about a movement like the lawyers movement during Musharraf’s time then nothing that won’t happen. That movement was very carefully orchestrated by I believe NS and Zardari. When thinking about all the events and the current situation, the words of a UAE royal come to mind when he said in wiki leaks describing Zardari as dirty and NS as dangerous but not dirty. These 2 we’re together during Musharraf’s reign and are now also together in government.

Coz the previous lawyers' movement was created by an estab (Kiyani) tired of its chief (Musharraf).

Adil Raja's delusions aside, the biggest proof that estab is behind Munir is that there's no lawyers' movement today.

Lawyers don't care unless they are on receiving end. I am surprised you are idolizing lawyers so much. Most corrupt idaara in our country is judiciary. Everyone from peon to SC judge are so corrupt. You would know had you gone to courts ever.

The lawyers movement was one of the worst things to happen to this county amongst others because then every other lawyer started acting like a scum. Remember the clash they had with young doctors a while back in punjab where they attacked a hospital and turned off vents??

Establishment was behind the lawyers movement. Lawyers don't go against the establishment.

Remember to start a Change you don't have to become fearless but need to become one who is feared.

Because now, the west is supporting PDM and Establishment nexus. 2007 lawyers movement had the financial and moral backing of western powers who were getting tired of dealing with Musharraf.

Samjh nahi aata ab sab ki masoomiyat pe hasna chahye ya rona chahye.

There wont be one until they sack CJP. Dont care much about constitution though.

PTI and IK haven't failed. They've done their part. The rest of it lays in the hands of the people.

We've had a lot of high ranking PTI members leave. I've seen people mock them for leaving. They might not be perfect and some may have used PTI to get into politics and get a seat/ticket. But I'm sure many share IK's vision. Imran Khan is one man and he can't do everything.

Many high ranking memembers have left due to being tortured and broken with arrests. The whole PTI Punjab/Sindh division will be dismantled. They're keeping them in KPK.

Imran Riaz is most likely dead. The fact that they won't bring him before a court. They may have accidently killed him while torturing him. This part is just my speculation.

The courts have failed and can't do anything. The decision lays in the people. PTI is the largest party in the country and has the most support. We're broken into two groups. Those in Pakistan and those who are overseas Pakistani's.

We can speak to the local government bodies in which ever countries we live in. More impact if it comes from UK, US or Canada. We know they've been quiet so far unfortently, but can't give up. We can expose the Sharif's businessess in the UK. They own a few food places in places like Birmingham.

It's those in Pakistan who have the biggest struggle. You've shown you are brave enough to come into the streets. I saw a video of some kids chanting "Imran Khan Zindabad" while a pro Army rally was going on. I never thought in my life that Pakistani's would show so much courage. But now it needs to happen outside of PTI/IK. It should be done and shown to the international media that we're pushing for elections.

I don't beleive another May 9th will work. What needs to happen now is to bring the whole country to a stand still. Block roads and sit outside GHQ. Blocking all roads in. Stream it and share it on social media. A peaceful sit down outside GHQ in Rawalpindi.

Edit: Another I believe which will have a massive impact. Is a veteran march. If veterans who fought for this country begin a march on GHQ. It will have the biggest impact of all in my opinon. 

We Pakistani people only respect people when they die. Just like I.K., we abused Benazir before she was killed, like Zulfiqar and Fatima Ali Jinnah. I.K. is now above 70 years of age, he just can't struggle more than 5 years at max. He will die, naturally, and then the same people who are against him today are going to use his name to win elections.  


**The system is NOT broken. The system is working exactly as its supposed to.**  


with that said,  


**The system needs to be destroyed.** 

**And whether you like it or not, only a dictator, with his brain and heart in the right place, can destroy this system.**

This sub has really gone to the shitters hasn't it..

Dude, don’t give any false hopes. 10,000 people have been arrested without warrants. They are being kept in cages and are given dog food. Sexual abuses and crimes are being committed just like they did to Shehbaz Gill. 

But CJI gave bail to IK within one day. CJP also asked IK what he would like for dinner and IK said I want lamb curry. Guess what IK was not given dog food, he was given lamb curry and treated as a guest of CJP at Islamabad Guest House. 

Atleast until these 10,000 arrested PTI supporters are released, keep your testosterone addled d*ck in your pants and stay silent. If we live today we can fight another day. Let’s just not talk about inquilab for a while.

I completly agree, 
Peolple disagree that things are going just like in the past, they dont. They are doing same things in punjab that they did in other provinces, the fact that they had to do this is they r getting out of options. And now punjab has realizes what happend and who did all the things in other provinces.
This is the biggest gamechanger.

Bhai ghq pe peaceful protest toh hua tha. Dekh lo kia bna.

Haha! Look at the responses! These same people will wonder why people did nothing for Fatima Jinnah, 1971, or the coup against ZAB.

The common man has got enough problem at their hands. No need to take on further problems.

Please stop inciting riots

You absolute imbecile, you should go out and help the women who are jailed up and being harassed first. Then think about a new revolution. The people you are fighting for a ditching you day by day and you still fail to see that you have been used

PTI's Iron Lady @Dr_YasminRashid has been arrested!

100+ army officers and their wives. Senior generals, brigadiers current and former.
Asim is doing a purge.

I remember when she was put against Maryam Nawaz for a constituency in Lahore and lost. Lahoris are something else

This woman is a national treasure. You know things are bad when she is being abducted.

she is over-hyped without doing much

I had alot of respect for this lady. Like the utmost respect. But it went down the drain when she ordered the mob to attack Corp Comd's house. Really sad. I hope the audio is fake

\&gt;Iron Lady

Do Pakistanis even know who the original *Iron Lady*, Margaret Thatcher, was? That p\*ssbaby f\*\*ked over countless working class folks like UK Pakistani immigrants throughout the 80s and created rifts in British society that are still felt to this day.

Is it too much to ask for a bit of self-awareness from Pakistan's most popular political party's Twitter team?

Swarm of baton-wielding Rangers drag away former Pakistani PM Imran Khan from Islamabad Judicial Complex



Ahh, the decent hard working men of lower ranks just obeying the orders. It is not their fault at all.

So they were pushing him around when he couldn't keep up the pace due to a leg that's not still properly healed.

Trailer of what's to come.

Khoon kab kholega awaam ka

The most wanted man in Pakistan. Wanted by both the Pakistani people and the establishment but for different reasons.

he can’t even stand straight and they are pushing him🫤

If I was imran khans political opponent the last thing I would do is have him arrested.

Pricks

I hope when these men go home and their kids ask them why they stood on the side of fascism and tyranny their guilt eats them alive

Kash yhi black vigo ye corrupt officials k liy use hoti, terrorism fhelane walo ke liy hoti..lekin Jung Kaddi Jitti Nai, Election Kaddi Hareya Nai...save the country

This shall pass and the country will stand strong against the terrorists in uniforms and politics.

Be positive, at least He is walking on his legs again.

Corruption is currently winning in Pakistan - hopefully the people in Pakistan won't stop pressuring the current thug regime in charge, in regards to their ongoing corruption.

They all look like insects

Al-Qadir trust case : Did Khan make one too many mistake

Going through the details of this case, it seems like a clear case of financial misconduct by the Oh so holy IK, why would you forego £190 million for the Pakistan state, against the adjustment of a payable fine by MR from another case. 

This is a clear loss of £190 million to the national treasury of Pakistan and what makes it even more criminal is the benefits Imran Khan and his accomplices such as Farah Gogi gets after all this fiasco in the name of a University trust.

Why is this sub so easily brushing it all under the carpet even though we all know the bane of all problems is military of Pakistan but you can't let anyone's corruption escape under the garb of being an anti-state/military Messiah.

Sauce: 
https://www.dawn.com/news/1751790/imran-arrest-what-is-the-al-qadir-trust-case

Can your country allow people go to court in peace without killing them? Why not?

investigate and put him on trial, throw him in jail if hes found guilty, but the scale should be the same for everyone, that moron from London should also be thrown in the jail. Again, this does not justify the fascism that this PDM government is retorting to

So if I'm understanding this correctly. Al Qadir trust is a non profit owned by IK and his wife. Bahria town owned by malik riaz donated land to it. 

IK's government had previously helped Malik Riaz by basically using the funds from one case in uk to pay the fines for another case in Pakistan. 

Thus the allegation is that these 2 are connected. 

The case aside, IK fucked up big time by working with Malik Riaz.

Meanwhile justice being delivered to Sharif's 

https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/13dlzf7?is_gallery=true

Have a fair trial, IK said himself that if you can get a warrant, no need to go through all this.

He was illegally takrn and basically kidnapped **WHILE IN THE COURT**. That is not how the law works.

This is the favourite tactic of the army "look how corrupt the politicians are!!!, We'll do the accountability" but nothing ever happens.

In this case IK is clearly in the wrong but so is Malik Riaz. But no one even touches him. Yes IK needs to be accountable but not to the benefit of the military.

Nothing in that article (your source) is clear. Everything in there is being speculated. This should be a straight forward case. Govt should show where the money came and went. Yet nothing has been put out, why? If he did wrong then by all means try him in court. But nothing in that article is “clear”.

I honestly don't care. If he is guilty he should be put in jail. Then start putting all generals and corrupt politicians as well. What Imran Khan has started will move with or without him. We want rule of law and don't care if next person who gets beheaded is Imran Khan or Asim Munir.

Hey bro can you make the same post for Shahbaz Dalla and his chicken shit son getting away Scot free from their corruption cases?

No? 

Huh.

Bruh, prove this in court, not on reddit. While you do so, bring back nowaz shareef back for trail because the law should be equal for everyone. Open the case of army skimming tosha khana gifts, also let ik register fir against current and ex chief of army staff. Bring bajwa's family in court for property embezzlement.

You dumb buffoon use your brain for once.

Everyone becomes mandela when their theft is caught. Why was everyone quiet when imran took the support of army in 2011?

Malik riaz the main preparator is missing , justice for all? Meanwhile shabaz and hos son found not guilty on all cases?

Valid questions - for which there are courts.

He was supposed to, and should have, answered all this in the courts.

Why dont you ask IK this question or get an answer from him?

Listen bud no one here is defending the corruption you wanna tell us IK is a POS guess what we know he is a POS  


The problem is the rest of the kleptocrats are worse by a foreseeable margin no one is being fooled by this topi drama of "won'y anyone think abt debelopment"  


these beghairats had their chance you wanna talk corruption how about we talk about the 1 million acres of land that the military had demanded for corporate farming this February  
([https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1068830-army-requested-1m-acres-of-state-land-in-punjab-for-farming-lhc-told](https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1068830-army-requested-1m-acres-of-state-land-in-punjab-for-farming-lhc-told))  


You wanna talk corrupt leader Shabaz f------g Sharif is your current PM this is topi drama at this point. They wanna put their chamcha's over   


and think this topi drama of "look gaiz fauj and gobermint is ver patriotic we ijj do jo muzh debelopment" ain't working anymore

IK made mistakes? Bhai wo farishta hai. Wo kabhi ghalat nai ho skta. Its impossible for hin to do anything wrong.

Bruh, people voted him for his LOOKS only, you think they wanna hear that truth that their daddy IK is a filth too? They are ready to eat lies of IK but won't confront him.

This sub lately seems to be a paid shill for pro PTI content, let our disgruntlement over establishment not take over our conscience and ability to call a spade for what it is.

It’s ridiculous. Even if he wasn’t clearly guilty in the case (he is), dude refused to show up to hearings or cooperate with the investigation in any way. This is what happens when you refuse to show up to court, you get arrested. 

You won’t find that kind of critical thinking in this sub though, PTI supporters would rather burn down ambulances and city infrastructure than let their demagogue suffer the consequences of his actions. They preach about rule of law, the constitution, respect the courts, blah blah, but they don’t actually care about any of it, only Imran.

Have a fair trial and include Malik Riaz too

Yes it's wrong, but what has ever been right in Pakistan

We have heard way way too many allegations and speculations and outright fabricated lies against IK, without any decent proofs. He has 140 cases against him - for sure fabricated. He cannot keep going to court for all of them - he goes one a day half the year he is just going to courts. 

Everyone knows what’s going on - PDM are corrupt to the core and are just trying to throw whatever filth they can at IK to save themselves and hide their corruption. they don’t give two hoots about the law (not holding elections a blatant case in point).

Everyone should be held accountable. If IK is corrupt then so is sharifs and bhuttos and the army.  If Pak courts do same justice with everyone we will accept it otherwise its nothing but political vengeance

We don't deserve him...



The sane among us do deserve him. And we are in the majority.

Really feel bad for imran khan. :(

Maybe you dont deserve him. But I do

I feel guilt and fear at the same time , mostly fear wins.

We literally don't

Problem is he is fighting a lot of battles at the same times. Corruption is so entrenched in our society that if they all gang up , they can give tough time to Tiger like Imran Khan. 
Sadly the tipping point is army chief. This chachu whiskey is on Corruption side so immy need to either up his game and reply back every attack or go down while fighting.
Imran khan has surely secured a valid answer to the question on day if judgment. You were given money power fame l, what did you do with it. 
However pdm and army needs to think what will they say

Bas in dialogue bazion mein khush hote rehna.

I love him so much. For me, he's higher than Jinnah. 

Jinnah did nothing to make Pakistan better after 1947 because of his poor health. 

Imran Khan will roar again!!

His tajurbakaar team is on backfoot. Soon he will be too. He will settle for lesser, a mid way for both parties. And guys here would forget about it, like they did with all weirdest conspiracies.

What is PTI without Imran Khan?

Disclaimer: I am not pro PTI and I despise the PDM lot.

Can Imran Khan's supporters tell me what is PTI without Imran Khan? I don't see one person that can overtake his place in the current situation. And whose failure is it that PTI doesn't have another alternative waiting in case something goes wrong? So is it good that Imran hasn't prepared anyone else, is it bad? Tell me what you think.

And please don't recommend Murad Saeed in the very least. That'll be a humble request. You can say another name that you like if you have someone in your mind.

Hammad Azhar, Faisal Javed and although you said don’t mention but Muraad Saed in my opinion those 3 are the future of the party and IK needs to do more to bring them forward but unfortunately he’s made political alliances by bringing people like SMQ and Pervaz Chaudhry to higher positions. 

It’s not just a PTI issue though, politics in Pakistan is too much focused on the ‘leader’ and the personality and not much on the party and it’s ideals. IK tried to distinguish PTI by not naming it after him like PMLN and by not having any children involved. But Pakistani awaam themselves are too obsessed with leaders and personalities and not so much the party. 

Think about U.K. and US democracy, parties in both countries have had countless leaders but people stick to voting them for generations because of the type of government and ideals they want to bring in not because of the leader themselves.

&gt;Disclaimer

It's sad how peeps can't get themselves to criticize PTI without being accused of being a PDM supporter

Pervaiz Elahi.

Without IK, pti is one big rogue group which no one would be able to control.

PTI is IK 
IK is PTI 
No IK 
No PTI

This sub was saying that SMQ was gonna take IK's place a week ago. Lol

Personally I think even if this happens to be the end of IK and PTI, they have done their job by changing the narrative and what we also have to consider is even if the other side managers to maintain their power one way or another the people will get rid of them

Pervaiz Elahi

His nephews.

An actual opposition party to PDM. More parties with varying people means a better chance to be able to have someone sane.

Murad Saeed. 🤔

It’s not about PTI or IK, it’s bigger than that. People want change. They’re tired of seeing the same old faces carrying on with the same old policies for decades. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the voter demographics is changed in Pakistan, boomers are gone and the newer generation doesn’t want to end up like their parents. What IK and PTI represent is an additional option that’s not ‘Sharif’, ‘Bhutto’ or ‘General’. Without IK if PTI remains a democratic political party with new faces and new ideas, people will still vote for them. If not then they’ll raise another political opposition from the fringes. This isn’t the 90s where the voter base was made up of boomers. Pakistan has a young population and the good thing about this demographic is that they want to see change fast.

Lets start full force propaganda

Protests don't work, violence can't work. Non-cooperation is impossible cuz there is always another haramkhor. But one thing we have noticed is that these guys are obsessed with their image. Banning Accounts left and Right, silencing people, etc. 

See, in this age of information, it is nearly impossible to hide something. We can spread propaganda against every organization/general/politician that we know is doing something immoral.

In order to do that, we create an anonymous social media account in reddit, insta, tiktok, youtube and twitter. It should be anonymous, and consistent. Make the most humiliating, personal memes possible. Shit that would make the 4chan look sane. 

Then we make documentaries, without using a face, and an AI voice, Video archives of all sus speeches made by our politicians, even Imran Khan's fails, all public statements, and especially the police, ranger, and army brutality. 

Then we create a site like wikileaks but for pakistan stuff. Our own version of The uncensored library.

Interesting but wouldn’t you get caught and possibly abducted?

This isn't exactly a new idea, a family friend got a legal notice from FIA for making anti army memes on Facebook way back in 2016, But no one really cared back then....

Let's do this. If you're worried about being abducted I'd love to get involved as I'm born English so they can't do much to me here. I also know other people here who would be happy to get involved.

We don’t need to do anything crazy. Just keep posting on social media and challenge lies being perpetrated.
Use anonymous accounts if that is more comfortable.

But no need to get personal or abusive.

Can't we sic 4chan on them by telling them that chicken tendies will get banned if the army takes over.

Mckinsey hired bajwa’s son - we should all blame and shame mckinsey

Fortunately to expose characters as nasty and inhumane as the Pakistan army generals and political mafia you don't need propaganda, you just need the truth. Social media is doing a very good job of preserving the truth and i hope it continues to do so.

In Pakistan we have “bhang” it gets you high, but not high enough to do what you’re saying lol 

I think an armed secret militia is what’s needed, made up of all ethnic groups, you only target police and not the army, police is not well trained and behave like attack dogs, you forced them to stick to there police stations, imagine no cops asking for rishwat when you are driving or just walking, imagine no cop thinking he’s above the law and all

If any of you are familiar with the game hitman, it is possible to  just raise money and hire hitmen for these imbeciles .

They'll care if their recruitment numbers drop. 

More than their image, it enrages them when they feel one of their own is working against them.

Its not worth it. Protests in Iran was way bigger. People used twitter and street to bring change. 

leave this country and save your family

ok mr. gen-z goebbels.

Pakistan is the only country in South Asia to allow military courts to try civilians for non-military offences, including offences related to terrorism.

Someone tell those old scriptwriters to atleast have a new script

Those lumber 1 agencies think that people will dall again for the same old script they did with MQM(avid HATER of MQM) but PTI HAQIQI k baad even a blind person can see what they are doing... BC naye naaray aur naye scriptwriters Rakh lo

Why would they? They know Pakistani people love watching the same old dramas. Yahan pe bhi chaley ga.

That's hilarious

I called it!!!!

Why is it Haqiqi when IK is in haqiqat. Morons

They r still using a 50 year old manual.

PTI kay loyal MNA's fear party may get banned soon. So they are making bloc to prevent them from heat. It's no script. Chances of this new bloc gaining much traction are almost none.

My prediction, if Imran Khan survives, PTI will be relegated to Urban Politics of Lahore, Karachi and Provincial Politics of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

If Imran Khan manages to retain his position, it is likely that his political party, the PTI, would primarily focus on urban politics in cities like Lahore and Karachi, as well as provincial politics in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. These regions have traditionally been the stronghold of PTI, where Imran Khan enjoys significant support and connects with people on a political level. By concentrating their efforts in these areas, the PTI could aim to consolidate their base and maintain influence within these specific domains of politics.

This is where his organic support base is and people politically resonate with him the most here.

Wouldn't say PTI has a Karachi stronghold.

Why do you think so and why should PTI just become a regional party? PTI has plenty of support in Punjab's rural areas while MNA from Rawalpindi just left PTI.

My prediction is that couch intellectuals will be proven wrong time and again.

Karachi ??😂not as long as ppp is still alive

You are wrong.

IK arrest was suppose to be a distraction so that elections don’t take place. What ensued with the riots scared the sh*t out of everyone and just gave us a glimpse of what could go wrong if things got out of control. The silver lining (if you can call it that) is that everyone realized that they need to calm the situation down and that’s why everyone backed off, no one forced into Zaman park, CJP’s ruling that the opposition and the government negotiate, PTI leaders staying silent, etc. 

Now what’s going to happen to PTI? Nothing. The voter demographics have changed massively. Information is out in the open even in rural areas of Pakistan. What the new voters want is change. They’re tired of of the same old faces their fathers and in some cases their grandparents have been seeing. Pakistan has a predominantly young population with millions of new voters in every election cycle. PML and PPP are struggling because of that. It’s clear that the power wielded by the army, PPP and PML has been diminishing. It doesn’t matter if it’s PTI or any other political party people want change. After PTI there will be another political party to take its place who’s leaders aren’t a Shareef, Bhutto or a general. Change is here to stay but it will take some time.

The best Plan the opposition and Army has is to Limit Imran khan, PTI would emerge as the single largest Party but not enough to make government,

Why are the osps silent though? I mean with what is going on in Pakistan, the abductions and all?

**May be. But I don’t think PTI headed by IK will survive.**

IK drew the first blood from the Pindi Boys. Now the Boys are out to get him. They are already strategising on multiple fronts. Resignations from PTI leaders, Silence of Pervez Khattak, SMQ, Sheikh Rashid, Elahis etc., Crackdown on PTI supporters, Criminal cases on IK etc. 

**In October 2023, both CJP Bandial and President Alvi will retire**. There will be no one left to help IK in legal cases. Toshakhana, Al Qadir Trust Case are very strong from legal point of view, and IK could easily get disqualified if Bandial is not CJP. Boys will wait until that time for disqualification. IK will most probably get a deal and leave the country. He won’t be jailed.

Yesterday Pervez Elahi already said that in case IK is sidelined from politics then PTI will sort of change the name but will continue under a new leadership. SMQ wants to stay in jail for now, because he wants to play for both IK and Boys’ side. Media talk is that he is getting 5 star hotel type of treatment in jail. Probably because of Boys’ influence. 

We must appreciate for what it is. IK led people against Pindi Boys further than any political leader has done ever before. But it is time for IK to take the punch in the face and go down like the Hero he is. May be our next rebellion under another leader will be successful.

My prediction, if napak porn army is not dismantled it will destroy pk.

Karachi PTI is dead

KPK and central Lahore it's alive which means it will grab both provinces
Quetta it will have some seats
Sindhis never vote for anyone other then Bhutto so that's a no starter

If PTI survives, nothing will change as long as power is controlled by the select few and certain someone pulls the strings.

Lumber #1 army will destroy the country from within.

In the waning days of his tenure, details of Bajwa and his family's tax and assets documents were leaked to the press by journalist Ahmad Noorani on his blog *Fact Focus*, alleging an increase of nearly Rs. 13 billion in the general's family's assets throughout his tenure as army chief, including an international business, multiple foreign properties and capital, as well as commercial plazas and properties, farmhouses, and residential real estate throughout the major cities of Pakistan.\[77\]Bajwa's daughter-in-law became a Pakistani billionaire a few days before being wed to Bajwa's son, largely through receiving property in the army-run Defense Housing Authority (DHA), while Bajwa's wife became a multi-billionaire through his tenure as army chief, and she was repeatedly warned by Pakistan's tax bureau the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) for concealing assets.\[78\] The report has also alleged that the father-in-law of Bajwa's son has similarly amassed wealth, both in Pakistan and abroad, throughout his tenure as army chief.\[78\]

Bajwa reacted to the report by denying involvement in the affairs of his family members, and by inviting the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to interrogate them if any discrepancies are found in their asset documents.\[79\] Following the publication of the article, the media platform FactFocus faced government blackouts in Pakistan.\[80\] Reporters Without Borders condemned the move, calling it "unacceptable in a mature democracy that a perfectly sourced and careful investigative report about an issue of considerable public interest for Pakistanis should be brutally censored in this way".\[81\]\[82\]

Although army spokesmen rejected the claims as "baseless" "propaganda",\[83\]the country's tax bureau began probing over a dozen government officers,\[84\]\[85\]and suspended two high-ranking officers, both in connection to the tax claims,\[86\]\[87\] while the Pakistani government declared the tax leak by Noorani as illegal,\[88\] and announced that they had tracked down the persons responsible for what they termed as a leak\[89\]\[90\]- contrary to the claims of army spokesmen. In December 2022, the federal tax bureau formally charged three government officers for unauthorized access into the tax records of Mahnoor Sabir, daughter-in-law of Bajwa, and illegally shared that information.\[91\] Following the announcement of the government's investigations, Ahmed Noorani claimed that the government of Pakistan, in particular the finance minister Ishaq Dar (who had labeled the data mentioned in the article as an "illegal and unwarranted leakage"\[92\]\[93\]) had essentially authenticated Noorani's tax leaks by acknowledging the data as a "leak".\[94\]

Following General Bajwa's retirement, the mother of slain journalist Arshad Sharif requested the Chief Justice of Pakistan to formally charge General Bajwa, among other military officers, for the "targeted, premeditated, planned and calculated murder" of her son, claiming members of the military's Public Relations division began threatening Sharif after he emerged as a critic of General Bajwa following the success of the vote-of-no-confidence against Imran Khan, particularly in a program called “Woh Kon Tha”, aired on ARY News, in which Sharif insinuated General Bajwa had a hand in overthrowing his democratically elected Prime Minister.\[95\]\[96\]

clearly evident that the army is pissed, but that dosent mean you can try civilians under army act, joke of a country, joke of a circus parlament that can't even tackle being criticised

Yeah, that goes to show you the power of the military. Instead of Bajwa being charged with corruption, those who brought his corruption to light were sent to jail instead.

It is all an ecosystem. Our entire political history can be summed up in 10 steps. 

**Step 1:** Boys bring their pasandida politicians into power.

**Step 2:** Puppet politicians transfer state land to Boys for golf courses, boys owned factories, DHA etc.

**Step 3:** Puppet politicians allot huge defence budget while rampant illiteracy (low education budget) and diseases (polio etc.) and all other social sector sufferings spread. 

**Step 4:** Puppet politicians and Boys collude to shamelessly hog all foreign investment. Pizza franchises, Island ownership, Dubai highrises you name it.

**Step 5:** Boys ignore and turn a blind eye to Puppets’ corruption. 

**Step 6:** Baammmmm! Economy ki halat kharaab. approach IMF and so called friendly countries (who see us as nothing more than beggers) and normalise the term “beggars can’t be choosers”

**Step 7:** Boys note that people’s sentiment is against puppet. Core boys meeting will be held to discuss economy. Lol. Geoeconomics proposed. 

**Step 8:** Abhi bhi haalat nahi sudar rha hai. So change the government and bring in new (or old depending on point of view) puppets. 

**Step 9:** Jail the protesters and try to assasinate popular leaders. Say things like India and Israel are going to attack us. Boys ke khilaaf bolna Mulk ke khilaaf bolne ke barabar and someother sh!t. 

**Step 10:** Boys do a Coup and 10 year military rule. After 10years, repeat Step 1.

While protests against Pakistan's state of emergency continue, the country's army remains in firm control of businesses worth an estimated $40 billion -- about 10% of the economy... The Rand Corporation's Seth Jones says... "...\[C\]orporate enterprises \[controlled by the Pakistani military range...from private security firms and bakeries, farms, schools, to insurance companies, cement and cereal manufacturing plants... the specifics are very secretive... It's my understanding that the profits actually go to the Ministry of Defense and the individuals involved in it."  


The military’s business activities are essentially run through two entities, the Fauji Foundation (FF) and the Army Welfare Trust (AWF), with high net profits and rapid growth.  
The military’s Defence Housing Authorities (DHAs) also enjoy significant privileges in terms of federal sales tax exemptions and the earmarking of property tax, which goes solely to cantonment boards.  
The report's biggest takeaway, however, is the damning statistic that Pakistan’s elite – the top 1% of its population - has 9% of the country’s total personal income.  
“The average income of high net-worth households is six times the income of an average Pakistani household,” the report said. “Despite this, high net worth individuals evade taxes worth Rs168 billion.”  
The report highlighted the stark contrast between the elite rich and powerful and the underprivileged. The extensive study quantified the privileges such tax benefits the country elite and powerful groups such as feudal landowners were attracting.    
The poorest 20% of the nation hold 7% of the national income while the richest 20% have 50% of the national income.

bois will start to eat their kin soon enough, and that will be the final blow to them. just like nokia snake

They've done it before, they're experienced. It's rather fascinating how these dumb c#nts ended up being generals. I doubt there's any merit in the institutions.

Every year, more than 177,000 Pakistani children die before their fifth birthday due to malnutrition, yet we focus on issues like Kashmir, Palestine, and Bosnia, which have had far fewer casualties in the last 20 years compared to a single year of child deaths from malnutrition in Pakistan.

Why does a poor nation like Pakistan possess more nuclear arsenal than India? 🤷‍♂️ It's because our leaders have sold the idea that we are responsible for liberating everyone, even though our population is suffering.

I appreciate the energy here, boys and girls. However, it's unlikely that anything will change because our army is backed by major foreign powers, who use them as assassins when needed. Nevertheless, it's good to see the veil that Zia put in place is finally lifting now.

member Ghafoor? I member

Quick question, why is everyone calling the army “Lumber”?

Faiz abu k bare me bhe likho

Imran will catch up. Rs50bn and a few hundred kanals land from Malik Riaz is a good start.

The reality of the situation

You can argue all you like about who said what, the role of judges, legislative Vs executive etc etc.
But the simple fact is that all of this could be avoided if the ruling coalition had upheld their constitutional duty and held elections when they were meant to be held. They refused for their own benefit and now that there's been a reaction they're deflecting by saying why are people reacting like this. 

People in more developed and functioning nations have rioted and protested for far less. In France they're protesting and rioting because they raised the pension age by 2 years. Can you imagine what they would do if the ruling party decided to suspend democratic elections indefinitely?

So please stop with this cognitive dissonance and muddying of waters. The truth is democracy and democratic processes provide stability. That's why it's the system everyone looks to. When you stop that process you should expect instability and chaos.

It kills me to see Pakistan tearing itself apart like this. But the fact is this isn't so much about Imran Khan, but more anger directed at those in power abusing it and thinking they can keep getting away with it with impunity.

Agreed, IK packed his bags and went home, he couldve kept on dragning this as PDM is, the courts are just a joke at this point. 
Look at turkey, still holding elections after the earthquake. Morons here (army and the PDM) went from not having money to not having soldiers, these same soldiers for some reason were available to take over 3 provinces ffs, mockery

You are absolutely correct. Its insane how many people seem to blaming the protestors instead of our shitty government and army. Like seriously, i browsed r/islamabad and holy shit they are blaming everything on the people and the protestors. If our government and army wasn't so shitty, the protests wouldn't have happened. Destroying important infrastructure sucks but there is nothing you can do about it. Infrastructure is always going to get destroyed in protests like these. These are the consequences. People should be more mad at the army who are slaughtering people.

Have you seen the absolute state of Pakistan,  it's people and the "Leaders" ? 

Pakistan is a Toilet. The game is rigged. You need a complete reset of the Military leadership and the PPP/PMLN leadership exiled or jailed for their crimes.

This "constituon" and "democracy" bs needs to stop and people/Institutions need to be held to account

Well said

This exactly this the kleptocrats knew what they were doing they knew that and yet they continued to be mutmain beghairats. They had zero concern for any of the actual issues in our nation like Economy,rising inflation, low GDP growth rate etc. Or the increasingly authoritarian situation here  


Heck 3 days back these degenerates were making laws about "Contempt of Parliament" and are now shocked pikachu face when people finally had enough and started rioting

Oh no, someone trying to speak sense. 

This is Pakistan bruv, no amount of logical reasoning will cure this country. Better pack your bags and leave.

And petition SWIFT to cut this country off from international banking.

Correct.

Comparing France to Pakistan. Economy 8X larger with 4X less people. They can handle losses and few days off. We can't. 

Secondly, PTI ain't no saints worth fighting for. They got PML(Q)'s members with them. And they happily allied with MQM in past.

7/10

It's only fair on IK that he has his day in court before general elections are called.

Pakistan won’t achieve anything with democracy right now , we need to first educate and develop our population first , then when people are aware and less prone to being manipulated and being radicalized then we could look at civil rights and democracy

PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah was abducted, beaten, and humiliated by masked men, including an army officer. He believes it was retaliation for exposing the ruling government's hypocrisy, controlled by the military. Sanaullah vows to keep advocating for democracy. This was in 2003.

Sanaullah vows to keep advocating for democracy. This was in 2003.

Looking at current situation I seriously doubt he learned a thing.

Fuck the generals man seriously. As a PTI supporter I condemn this. However that being said rana is a cunt

That is why Rana n Nawaz sharif type chys are fall back guys. They will come sucking up.

This mf was beaten many times. He was picked up during the IK government too because they found their heroin in his car. But boo hoo this mf should be hanged.

Democracy LOL, he can't even spell democracy , let alone advocate for it. He once tried to justify money laundering.

I thought it said "keep abducting for democracy" isn't far from reality.

Aw man as I was reading the title I was hoping it was recent news. But yeah like others said, this is fucked and if any of the other politicians had any balls or love for the country, they'd get together and kick out the army from politics.

whatever happened to him is condemnable, but shaking hands with those responsible is even worse. way to go rana g

Har zulm ki taufeeq ha zalim ki virasat.

Nothing fits better here.

Worst happened to him during PTI government when ANF (headed by Major General) came up with a case of 200kg heroine in his car. Everybody knew it was fake but Shehryar Afridi defended it and even vowed to share a video of the arrest. Later, even the PTI Ministers admitted it was all fake. I guess, Rana shb is still pissed at that lol

'Rupee may slump to 350 per dollar in June'



PKR has already devalued more than Rs 100 under PDM's 1 year. 

For reference, PTI inherited a bankrupt economy and fought through covid and PKR devalued Rs 64 in THREE+ years. 

Thank you dickless fauj. Thank you to the noonies and chirandi IK haters for voting these guys in and cheering in a military coup

Buy tissue paper now! It will be worth more than the rupee if Pakistan defaults due to PDM and the establishment!

This is probably why LHC has revoked the resignations. Need to try to at least show there's a functioning parliament lol but I don't think that's going to help. Country is on the verge of default so the PDM + military junta are making a final strong concerted effort to end PTI before the country is completely on its knees and they have no option but elections.

I am waiting for 400 though.

Aim for the stars .... Reach the moon!

"Jis din nayi hokumat ayi dollar mustahkum hua or stock market uper gayi" 🤡

Guess I'll die then

Me and my homies hoarding dollars like 👅👀

Thank you Imran Khan

^^^^^^^^/$

Thanks to all political parties for screwing over the country for last 15 years. Only winners are OSPs and freelancers.

Suriname's currency depreciated from 7 to 37 in 3 years. Argentine's depreciated 10X in 5 years, I believe Pakistanis can endure that for a little democracy. Just bring back import restrictions for anything unnecessary. We had huge surplus for March.

Bajwa's backdoor diplomacy and Modi's visit to Pakistan on April 9, 2021

&gt; Islamabad:— "Former COAS Bajwa made a deal with India on Kashmir. Former PM Khan discarded the deal when he got to know of it." - claims Pakistani journalist @HamidMirPAK

&gt; Islamabad: "This led to the differences between former PM Imran Khan and Bajwa, ending up with Imran Khan being ousted." - Hamid Mir

&gt; Hamid Mir believes opening of Kartarpur Corridor was part of General Bajwa’s backdoor diplomacy with India. artarpur Corridor is a visa-free corridor linking the Gurudwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, Pakistan, with the border of India. 

&gt; In February 2021, India and Pakistan surprised the world by announcing a sudden cease-fire on Line of Control. The cease-fire announcement was made in a joint statement by the militaries of the two countries on a ‘hotline contact’ between their DGMOs,  which had apparently taken place a day earlier.

&gt; Hamid Mir believes this cease fire result of backdoor diplomacy by military, but most importantly, Pakistan foreign office was kept in dark about what was happening.

&gt; Earlier, we had reported that India’s Prime Minister Modi was to visit Pakistan on 9 April, 2021 and new start in relations between India and Pakistan was to be announced, but visit was cancelled after Prime Minister Imran Khan backed out of it. Hamid Mir has confirmed the development in his article.

bois be FA pass and think himself as dollar store Julius Caeser. a reformer, a general, a strategist, an economist, a moderator, a genius, a foreign/international relations expert, a politician.

this man was running a circus lol

he’s making negotiating outside of Foreign office and not to mention excluding the entire senate, its almost as if they dont care to hide it

Bajwa the Snake was selling Pakistan out? Color me surprised. His failed "Bajwa Doctrine" has led us to this mess.

The  r a p i s t  does not ask for permission before he does his evil deeds

Similarly bajwa did not ask for permission before trying to f**k Pakistan

This isnt news and has been reported before. So sad IK was too stupid to see this through.

Ngl, while simultaneously criticizing bajwas role in this but pragmatically speaking this was a mistake of IK. It would be political suicide but it would be for the betterment of the region.

so who was the bottom? I had wager on Bajwa being the bottom

Shows how serious Army is about Kashmir. Holding the Kashmir Cow for 20 years on a stand still?

Well Bajwa was doing the right thing. Good luck ever progressing without having good relation with India especially since now when India has became way to powerful both diplomatically and economically.

What's so wrong with diplomatic and trade relations with India? We can still condemn the atrocities committed against Indian Muslims. Pakistan still has relations with Saudi despite their bombings in Yemen. Why the double standard?

Pakistan doesn't have any leverage in its relationship with India anymore.

And this sub was vehemently downvoting anyone who said Kashmir was sold to India by the last regime. Smh how times change

What business is it of the COAS to bypass the DEMOCRATICALLY elected government and interfere politically by superseding the leader of the country; the PM. 

The army has no purpose in politics, as per their own oaths. Their responsibility is the defence of the country, it’s people, it’s property and it’s borders; a job that they’ve FAILED to get done time and time again.

They truly deserve the title of Lumber 1

Honestly, It’d be amazing if Pakistan had a better relationship with India. So beneficial for us, especially. But with the current Modi government, it can and should never happen. They amount of shit that government has done to harm Muslims… Also, they have spewed so much hate against Pakistan too.

alhumdulillah imran khan was prime minister. he puts corrupt people in high ranks but at least he would never trade with indians. fuck them

To the pathetic \*\*\*\*\*s coming on here saying this was good for "the peace" between two countries, what peace are you talking about? Are you dfs okay with a "peace" where an entire region is under military occupation where Muslims are r\*ped, murdered, and disappeared every day by military personnel hell-bent on changing the demographics of said region? 

So much for liberalism and progressivism.

Genuine question from an outsider

How is the current situation different than how Nawaz Sharif was treated and how Pakistan Army/ISI favored Imran Khan?

As an outsider , you have to understand that only a Pakistani can understand the subtlety of politics and power dynamics in Pakistan.

We are a confused country who cannot decide whether we want to be a democracy or a military dictatorship so we keep flirting with both forms and have been since like the late 50s and the rules of engagement change all the time. Having said that, the army holds ultimate power because a) Politicians can't get their shit together mainly because they're in it to make money b) Barely any politician is popular enough to challenge the army, we had Mujib back when Bangladesh was Pakistan, they came head to head and with a little help from India became independent (which btw I don't blame them we treated them like shit). Bhutto was initially popular but by the time he was hung he was facing issues too. c) Generic power hungriness, much like Kim Jong or Qaddafi, nobody wants to let go off power and the perks that come with it. Yes our army chiefs change after some years now, so in that sense the top brass operates like a weird monarchy where the succession is military based rather than a one man dictatorship for life. 


Imran Khan like him or not has immense street power so when shit happens to him, it invokes a strong reaction hence the top leadership is also having difficulties with getting rid of him. My theory is that with each move they just gauge the mood of the public reaction.

How is it different? Well Panama papers for one was international evidence whereas this Imran case is probably bogus(though I will admit I haven't read it). Secondly, Imran probably was close with the army back in 2018 but the relationship soured in 2022

It's not. WHich is why PDM should support the anti army movement and then figure out the actual power sharing later.

Now you’re asking the questions no one wants to hear.

The [Sharifs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers_case) and [Zardaris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_charges_against_Benazir_Bhutto_and_Asif_Ali_Zardari) have collectively held and fought for power since the 80s.

Their reigns have consisted of Corruption, Incompetence, Nepotism, Insincerity and deliberate self-sabotage of Pakistani Nations.

They have faced Prison Terms due their wide range of crimes and have amassed an obscene amount of Wealth, Assets and Businesses all around the World. Pakistan stagnated and regressed massively underneath these guys and they've now forced their families and children onto the Nation with high positions.

IK on the other hand was British Socialite and arguable Cricket's greatest All-Rounders and Captains. He [helped fund and raise Pakistan's first Cancer Hospital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaukat_Khanum_Memorial_Cancer_Hospital_and_Research_Centre) and dedicated his life doing his best to better Pakistan. Whether he is right or wrong, he is genuine and doesn't have carry ulterior motives or hidden agenda.

Anyone who compares IK to these guys is either:

A) Dumb
B) Deliberately disingenuous.
C) Both

Nawaz and his tola have done corruption for decades, comparing Nawaz with Imran is absurd.
The problem here is the army getting involved in everything.

One of the major difference is public support. And Imran didn't get as much favor from the establishment as the current govt is getting. Army wasn't as much vocal against Nawaz Sharif as it is against Imran Khan.

Because Nawaz Sharif was convicted on corruption charges after the Panama Papers were leaked.

It's really that simple but you have already made up your mind by assuming “boTh siDeS aRe tHe SamE”.

Nawaz Sharif is internationally known to be corrupt, his arrest on corruption charges is justified

Imran is an actual leader and he have following in every circle.
Nawaz wasnt a leader and pakistanis didnt had a choice for a long period.
His lifelines were up, he used everyone saudis, qataris, judiciary, army, usa etc etc.
Imran gather his support from the public and every department of a country no matter how powerful that is have to yield before nation.
Nawazs cases were highlighted by the international media, he was anti establishment, maryam and her dawn lobby was the catalyst. There were different things going on with pmln.
Whereas immi although guilty of many things but he isnt corrupt he is a brick minded, bad decision maker, a rhetorical person, a volatile individual but he is not corrupt and he wants good for the public.
Nawaz was favored multiple times before but ganju brothers dont learn miserable thugs with vile offsprings same goes for corrupt diva benazir and family.

Where is Nawaz Sharif?

Nawaz Shareef was charged by the court and he was arrested on courts order. While Imran Khan was abducted by Paramilitary from within court premise and his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court.

People came out for IK while no one came out on the streets for Nawaz. People support IK, Nawaz doesnt have any street power.

Nawaz and his family was named in Panama papers, he failed to produce Money trail for his property and he was charged for it.

As for Imran Khan he is innocent. All bogus cases on him. He has provided over 40k receipts to the Supreme Court.

Don't go into this, all is bullshit. No one knows what the actual story is, everybody will answer like an intellectual knowing nothing. No one is worried about the people, justice, situation.

Imran Khan footage in supreme court 



Is this now??

His injured leg will become a topic of discussion for the next weeks.

mandatory "chal tou aise raha hai jese supreme court ne isko nahi, isne supreme court ko riha karna hai" comment

Unprecedented bravado by PTI workers

He is the 1st leader of pak who was arrested while in a wheel chair and now he is walking.
Baaki sbko chlty arrest kia aur wheel chair main paysh hoay.

Nothing weird here. Of course he can walk, but he *should not* exert much at all or the leg will never completely heal.

shameful our closest leader to Jinnah was treated like this, the generals will have to face justice, they also called the founder of Pakistan Fatima Jinnah a female dog, when they openly stole the election. These general snakes have been raping our country for long enough, India couldn't ask for better allies. Traitors the lot of them!

So , he can walk.🤔

This is from last year

Reminder: Imran Khan Had Severe Pain

It's very possible that they let him go because they did what they needed to. A **slow poison** to cause a heart attack is all that was needed.

What do you guys think? This would definitely be by far the best way to get him off, without causing an outright civil war.

**Also, congratulations to everyone! The army clearly backed off regardless of what they are planning. This was unexpected for them.**

I mean, it's too early to say anything. Stay away from conspiracy theories.. 

Imran will probably go and get tested at the hospital. Complete blood work and stuff will be done. Once reports come back, things will be clear. 

For that supposed "poison" it could be some form of sleeping agent that was injected to keep Imran unaware of his surroundings and possibly keep him awake enough to get answers or record his statements while he's under influence. 

As of now , it's all speculation. Let's see what Imran says. Since he has been released, things will become clearer as in the coming days.

Pti need to get IK checked up by leading doctors ASAP

I mean all it really takes is a small dose of ricin.

https://www.dw.com/en/spy-assassinations-the-top-5-deadly-poisons/a-42909685

Some of the examples for people asking.

Saala pados mein bhi kam conspiracy theorists nai hain!

They must have posioned him, they did try to kill him off in broad day light.. but that failed these treacherous generals will go to any lenghts to kill off our leader.

Generals must be arrested whether it by patriots in the army or the public, they have to face justice for high treason and attempted murder of the legitimate PM of Pakistan,

HaqiqatTV lol

Which poison?

How paranoid are we ?

Good thing that he's walking again. Remember he was on wheelchair when they arrested him, that shows you that at least they treated him good.

Aj tak sirf memes sunien thein Burgers pe ab dekh bhi raha hun.. Gosh u guys are childish.. think its some sort of Marvel Movie or some shit..

What is the name of this poison OP? That slowly kills you after weeks-months? You must know because you seem very convinced.

Lmaoooooooo

ARY has become establishment's tout

Ary has been compromised; they shamelessly rolled out fake news which accused Imran Khan of saying that he would maintain cordial relations with Asim Munir after coming to power.No other news channel reported this (not even geo new). I was completely shocked after seeing this since earlier IK had given a statement to international media in which he named COAS as the root of all problems. Turns out the news was totally fake and was rolled out at the exact moment when Imran Khan asked people to come out on streets. 

lesson to be learned from this is to stop watching ARY news, not just is their analysis biased against Imran Khan these days, they have also started spreading false propaganda.

Who is still watching ARY? Homies moved to BOL ages ago.

ary literally licking lumber 1 the past few days, calling PTI protestor for terrorists, playing bs army propaganda when half the country was burning. This channel fired Arshad Sharif, now claiming he was their own after he died, hypocrite of a channel

Oh how things change

Salman Iqbal is complicit in the murder of Arshad Sharif.

entire pakistani media is sold  
believe me i saw the news about protest after imran khan's on bbc and cnn before any pakistani channel reported it

Actually IK did say that if you watch the longer version of his press  conference.

He literally said "COAS is afraid he will get fired if I get back into power but I have no plans for that"

They've just switched sides, that's all. Obviously due to external pressure no doubt.

They always were. It was just that the establishment and PTI were on the same page for a very long time before the falling out in 2022.

Oh wow. So IK didn’t say about cordial relations with Asim Munir?

Disgusting behavior by ARY if true. I was literally criticizing IK when I saw that statement on TV.

What would ours look like?

🚨 Supreme Court declares Imran Khan's arrest null and void.

What are the repercussions for the people who did arrest him!?.

So what's gonna happen to those who arrested Imran Khan illegally? What about people who died at the hand of the Army and Police? Is PTI going to forget about people who died in protest or take some action?

Will he be released Immediately or is there a long drawn out process regardless of this statement?

We are winning, keep it up.

What was the point of arresting him if at the end of the day they would have released him like this!! What about the lives that have been lost in the protests?

3 days later...

Imran Khan release was illegal!

Alhamdulillah

Meanwhile PTV News: Sweets distributed in different cities on Imran Khan's arrest

PTV is living in an alternate universe

What is this shit

PDM supporters have no morals. Bunch of filthy pigs.

These piglets should rot in hell.

Inshallah their houses get burnt down

Insha’Allah every single one of them eating those sweets will suffer from food poisoning.

Only 23 people are watching their live

May they be guided…. &gt;!TO HELL!&lt;

Scumbags of the highest order.

Make a list... 

Set up guillotines in the meantime... Pakistan needs a thorough cleaning and complete reset!

PTV needs to be disbanded . Seriously.

lmao these people think they still have views for PTV

Not every one like IK , this sub don't understand that

This is true.

Aag lgi basti me ham apni masti me

Grow tf up?

its a government channel whadyo expect , turning a blind eye on all the atrocities happening outside of their little circle

Imran Khan look very weak in this video, I have never seen him this tired. I pray for his good health



Has anyone considered that the man has gone through a month of fasting and doesn't eat at buffets to open iftars? 

Chill out, he's strong as ever

I just think he has reached the realisation that there is no saving Pakistan.

  


Even the most resilient of personalities have a limit to what they can fight. The hardiest of warriors understand when the battle is lost.

With everything stacked up against him and a population thats not willing or unable to fight the oppressors, there's only so much an individual can do to change the course of a nation.

I just wanna hug him and say it's okay, go to the UK and rest with your family, you've done your part.

Poor dude is stressed out - raised shoulders reads as stress, tension or discomfort.

I don't think it's weakness. It looked like he put on a lot of weight after the assassination attempt because his leg was affected and it limited his mobility. But it now seems like he's lost that extra weight.

Now Only CJ can save pakistan . He should take strict actions against Ghaddar

Imran Khan attended a wedding I was at, 5 years ago. He was extremely thin and looked very weak. The phrase that came to mind was “hadion ka dhaancha.” Not saying that is relevant to politics, but I was taken aback by how how skinny his arms were.

Jissay ALLAH rakhay

Ussay Kon Chakhay

Abhi to party shuru hui hai

Failed state failed nation

The only saviour is the people itself. Mass riots and attacking every institution.

He is fucking 70 years of age, what do you expect

Cocaine zyada leli hogi.

Hopefully he realizes now that the main problem of Pakistan is not opposition parties but rather economy and non constitutional role of army in Pakistani politics. If he wants to be treated like a politician, he must also act like a politician.

Bro thinks he still has the KURSI xD

He’s on a diet guys, chill!

Gunshot injury means no excercise and your health will Deteriorate fast. 
Do you know that 80yrs old femoral bone fracture has higher mortality then cancer for same reason immobility kills you

I wish he is keeping his workout regime. That's only matters.

🔴 LIVE | Chairman PTI Imran Khan’s first address to nation after illegal abduction

Basic Summary

- I've no idea what's happening outside after the arrest
- Waiting to get the facts before coming to speak to the public
- PTI is the only Party where families come to our jalsas. Women get a seperate enclousure. We would not want violence, or any such sort of intishar
- When I was leaving for Islamabad, I knew they would be attempting some sort of arrest.
- Before leaving, I said this. **Plays a recorded video talking about don't bring FC, Rangers etc whatever, don't waste the nation's money, I am ready to be arrested. Just bring a warrant and arrest me.**
- Shows the video of his arrest and rangers breaking in.
- Before leaving, I clearly stated. Give me a warrant, I will follow the law and hand myself in for arrest.
- Calls out Army directly for their actions. Literally says "Rangers is Army". They were attacking as if I am the biggest terrorist of the world. More so, This is not the job of rangers, but rather the job of police.
- They hit people, hit civilians and eventually me as well.
- The world knows me, everyone knows that I am running the biggest party, cancer hospital etc all done charitably.. and this is how they arrested me? Not one criminal case in my entire life, and now I have 130 cases on me.
- The biggest dacoits don't get 15 criminal cases, while they've lodged 15 in one day on me.
- I want to make clear what the case is one me. Talking about Abdul Qadir
- I made a decision to promote Seerat-Un-Nabi because our morality has fallen in society. Our criminals are who lead us because overall, our country is not moral anymore.
- My goal to start Al-Qadir University was to create leadership qualities in people, to teach technology, to teach better morality. This decision was made in December 2018. 
- One sponsor came forward to be ready to build the university.
- Numal University is in 1000 acres. 90% get taught for free.
- This was to be another center to create leaders who are Sadiq and Ameen.
- 15 May 2019: I did groundbreaking of the university as PM.
- There's an agreement between NCA and Malik Riaz that's confidential. If we agree to the confidential agreement, we can get the money or we go back to the UK and fight the case. We've already spent X amount in foreign litigiation. We decided that instead of spending more money on foreign litigation, we take the money and end it.
- Repeatedly takes Malik Riaz's name.
- Al-Qadir is a trust, all of its fiancnes are audit-able. You're welcome to study those finances. Tell me how I earnt from that? 
- I am hurt more that my wife's name is in the trustee. What's a trust or trustee? They don't get paid, but simply a person who wants to do a charitable work by heart. 
- He trusted her, and therefore, she was placed as a trustee of the Al-Qadir Trust. 
- If NAB Chairman ordered this arrest, one of the most insane, this "bezammeer", he's creating warrants based on the fact that we're trustees.
- Does he not have any shame? You are begharit for doing such an act on a "purdah-dar" woman.
- Such a small salary and you're selling your zameer.
- I don't know what happened after the arrest,.
- When I left for Supreme Court, I learnt there's such fighting, violence etc.
- I took names of ISI general etc when I was shot, yet there was zero fighting, zero violence by my people.
- I want an independent investigation into buildings that have been burnt, and into the kids that have been shot by the police. There needs to be an inquiry. One from the CJ of Supreme Court. Not from this government. An indpenedent investigation that tells who wanted violence, and who took benefit from the violence? 
- They've used this to arrest over &gt;3000 workers. 
- Plays a short video : Shelling has started, people were praying namaz and shelling was happening. Shows video of people in plains-cloth shooting, being dropped off by army trucks. Bunch of clips showing various ISI shit that we've all seen on the subreddit. Multiple videos of army soldiers wearing civil clothes and coming out of trucks. Insanity.
- 2 ex-Ministers in Peshawar, they tried to stop people who were breaking stuff, burning things. They fought with our ministers. Who were these people comitting violence? 
- Liberty Chowk, we saw random, strange folks who were trying to push the general public towards going into cantonments.
- These "na-maloom" who tried to kill me in the judicial complex, were the same folks.
- There needs to be an investigation. I've never allowed my party to ever commit any violence. We will win elections by law and in the rule of law.
- I am incredibly sadenned by the fact that how they're treating women. 
- They're harrasing women, spreading fear. 
- France has massive protests, they're throwing petrol bombs at the police yet they never shoot? They never abduct people from homes? 
- Entire leadership is in jail using this an excuse? 
- How is it that TV has such a clampdown? 
- Only one sarkari version was working on every channel. 
- Every channel was showing "shar-pasand hai PTI". 
- They're not even smart enough to change their feed. It's the same thing for every channel.
- Where is Imran Riaz Khan? What's his crime? That he doesn't follow the lines of imported government? He's abducted, and he's gone, and he will be commited a lot of torture. 
- Imran Riaz was leaving the country, and he was caught. He was scared that what happened to Arshad Rashid, will happen to him.
- Raise our voices, he's got the biggest viewership. We're scared that he will be killed. We've heard nothing from Police as to where he's gone. If anything happens to him, the same who shot me, the same who killed Arshad Rashid. 
- If anyone doesn't official line, like sheep, they're picked up.
- Aftab Iqbal was abducted, finally let go now.
- God, such facism. What country is this? What democracy is this? 
- Overseas Pakistanis, look at what they did. No IMF is gonna help us rise. It's Overseas Pakistanis who will. They got out immediately. They know these things don't happen in a democracy. 
- I am talking of those who live in strange nations, they're more free there than my people here.
- It's because laws are followed. That's why they're able to say something.
- They think they can control people using violence. 
- I want to remind you of East Pakistan again today. I was playing a match against under-19. My plane was the last plane that came back.
- I remember their hatred towards us. Media was controlled back then, like it is today and we never knew. 
- Today, we have social media to prevent that.
- The amount of damage they've causd by shutting down internet, controlling media is wrong.
- Today, we need to learn what a terrible zulm happened to East Pakistan. 
- Their leader should've became PM. 
- We lost 90,000 soldiers.
- The amount of loss by people making decisions in closed-room is wrong.
- Hadud-Ur-Rehman Report was never shown in Pakistan.
- This is not how nations work.
- To ISPR sahib, you said some things while I was in jail.
- You said things like "I am doghla, double-sided". "That no dushman has damaged Army enough as me"... and that I will be crushed.
- You weren't even born when I was representing my nation in the world.
- I raised my nation's izzat in the world.

"ISI debriefed me on how much money they've stolen and taken out of the country"

I don't understand, why didn't ISI stop them??? And then if ISI knew... how are they still our 'leaders'? Brought the looters back to rule over us lol. They fucking hate us man 🫡

You know, the biggest slap on ISPR face was when Imran said that I had been representing Pakistan before you were born. That's enough to show who is more loyal to Pakistan. Almost all recent COAS left Pakistan after their retirement. Politicians, army, rich business folks leave Pakistan or transfer all the wealth out of Pakistan through their kids. Businesses dont even invest back. Their priority is to save and move money away from Pakistan because they dont trust the laws. Justice Isa dude is a stain on the justice system. They all legalized money laundering through their children and spouses. 

From all of this, Imran is the only politician who actually stayed in Pakistan. Who actually spends money in Pakistan. Who actually supports building things that bring some advantage to the country. They may not be perfect, but at least he tries. What did Shareefs do ? Luptop schemes and bridges. What did Bhuttos do ? Roti Kapra Makaan ? None of it is there. What did COAS do ? Sent his children abroad and moved wealth. What did MQM do ? Left Pakistan and reside in the US, UK, and Canada. They rule and ruin the country and leave as soon as they lose. They can't live on the same land that they carved and ruined with their own hands.

Khan casually destroyed DG ISPR's career :D

no major cable news channel showing IKs speech, free media for you

u/forwardclassroom2 you dropped this 👑

Getting Goosebumps watching this anyone

protest is at liberty chowk 5:30PM (asking or lahore)?

Not from Pakistan but I have read a bit about how Mahatma Gandhi brought the British Empire down with the innate human desire to be free and used Truth as his only weapon to accomplish it. Imran khan is also fighting for the same right to live freely and is using Truth to get there. He will win eventually because truth prevails in the end.

Imran Khan should have no problem if Gen(R) Faiz Hameed and co are tried under Army Act / Official Secrets Act

After recent riots on 9th May, 2023 and recent statement from corps commander conference I really think that it's about time we bring a few top generals who are inciting this current political mess. Generals who manipulate Pakistani politics and they always get away with it.   
But new, it's a new beginning and I believe that this will not be allowed any further.   
I hope that Imran Khan and PTI supporters will have no problem if Gen Faiz is tried in courts of law because that was Imran's mantra that generals are above the law.  

That's my opinion and you can disagree. No hard feelings.

Yeah why would we? I’m a huge PTI supporter but if khan comes back in power and starts sucking off generals again I won’t support him. There needs to be real change this time.

When has Imran Khan ever opposed this?

I was always skeptical of the “we are on one page” narrative during the last months of IK’s prime ministership. I hated that IK was sucking up to Bajwa so that his government stays in power. It could be IK’s hunger for power. But I see it as his intention to work with the devil to do good for the people. I may be wrong on this. 

But one thing I’m certain of is that Lt. Gen. Faiz supported IK in all manners of illegal and unconstitutional ways. Political engineering, kidnapping and assaulting Journalists, getting favourable judgements from higher judiciary etc. Even a former SC judge openly stated this about Lt. Gen. Faiz. These are the same things current Pindi Boys are doing for the present imported govt. So if it is wrong now, it was wrong then. This means Lt. Gen. Faiz needs to accountable and should be punished to the fullest extent of law. No more no less. So should the current Pindi boys. 

But the problem is who has the guts to bell the cat? I don’t think it will happen. Lt. Gen. Faiz will go scot free just like all the corrupt, evil and traitorous Generals before him.

Basically you are saying, that Generals close to PDM should be allowed to punish Generals close to Khan ?

man if India attacks I bet Nawaz sharif isn't coming back to Pakistan. but like if he doesn't would you still support him? I'm sure he won't come back, definitely won't. like he should come back he has stood by Pakistan his whole life. but he won't come back. 

...this post in a nutshell.

Yeah? Try them all? Where's the gotcha moment?

If that happens and Faiz spills all of IK, CJ and other PTI members secrets then what?

Hang trash like Bajwaa, Hafiz, Nawaz and Zaradri.  Hang IK afterward,  Trade off would be worth it for better Pakistan. This is something every patriot can agree to.

Why would he care? Jo marzi karain boiz bhai.

Sure man. Case of General Musharraf is prime example of this.

Al qadir trust case seems legit

No matter whether you disagree with how and why Imran Khan was arrested but Al Qadir trust case seems legitimate. There is a clear quid pro quo here. Thoughts?

TLDR: NCA reached a settlement of £ 190M with Malik Riaz. Instead of this money being returned to Pakistani state, it went to paying the fine imposed by SC on Malik Riaz in a separate case. Malik Riaz donated land to IK and his wife's Al qadir trust to build an university as a quid pro quo.

Guys check out the second link op has [posted](https://youtu.be/j75Jt-l7L-E). Its the best video i have seen on this case with complete neutral pov. And its from wajahat s khan so pti ppl (including myself) wont mind him either. As much as IK is better than all other politicians and establishment, he still has flaws and this case is legit af. 

The only problem in this case is real estate tycoon who everyone is afraid of naming, malik riaz. Govt cant pursue him because he has connections everywhere. Also, hassan or hussain nawaz are also involved in this shit. 
But all this is mentioned in this video so i would highly recommend watching this video

Isn’t there more to the story though? I’ve heard it doesn’t stop at Imran’s wife and her friend but ultimately ends up back to Sharif family? After all, the money raised in the U.K. came from the sale of one of Hassan Nawaz’s properties (so I heard).

I haven't been following things for a while, can anyone TLDR what it is?

The no. of people in the comments who DON'T understand basic math is astounding, to say the least.

&amp;#x200B;

Think of it like this:

I have to pay your daddy (the state) 100 Rs for punching you, his younger son.

I also have to pay your daddy (the state) 50 Rs for punching your older brother.

My best friend pays 50 Rs to your daddy (the state) on my behalf and you call it a day.

I STILL owe your daddy (THE STATE) 100 Rs for that other oopsie.

So Hussain Nawaz bought a property in London for 30 million pounds with ill-gotten money. He then sold it to Malik Riaz for 50 million pounds, who later surrendered it to the UK authorities as part of a settlement over his illegal assets. 

Imran Khan, while as Prime Minister, legalized the 190 million pounds that Malik Riaz had to pay back to Pakistan, and in return received a land gift from him. 

And the original fine of Rs. 460 billion on Malik Riaz was to settle cases on his Malir and superhighway projects which were grabbed in blatant violation of laws in which government of Sindh is his partner / sponsor!

As Khan Saheb himself would say:

کوئ رہ تو نہیں گیا ؟

........

اس حمام میں بھی سب ننگے ہیں 😢

Yes i agree it’s unfortunate that something like this could take Imran out on legal grounds

People stop quoting Dawn - it’s been biased for a long time.

Allah protect Sultan Imran Khan. Leader of the Ummah 😭

Fascist Pakistan Army and their poodles PDM

God Forbid, even if IK is gone, the country's population will do NOTHING but cry like babies. I wish sometimes we had the hot blood like Turks, that if something like this (God Forbid) were to happen in Pakistan, they'd come out in the open and HANG all these criminals in a Mob Justice.

The one line from movie "Nayak" where Amresh Puri says it so perfectly well. "First they'll shout, Then they will get tired, Then they'll sleep". Now tell me if this isn't how it plays in Pakistan.

Kuch bhi nahi hone wala bahi its all hoax

Edda toon maseeha.

Kya hoga is mulk ka!?

I feel extremely bad when I send these type of emails to my boss who is in US 🇺🇲 + gora. Seriously speaking, I think multiple times before sending and think about how these Goray will think about our country, on one hand I invite them to visit Pakistan and tell them about northern areas and beautiful landscapes and on other hand I send them these emails about unstabe political situation and chaos. 
Last email I send them was about power breakdown nationwide and was thinking even we are struggling to get the basic necessities. 
Behtar yehi k yahaan se hijrat karjao or mulk k liye Bahar se Dua kro warna aysi hee sharminda hokar emails send krty rahogy.

“And they are playing with law and order” 🤡 what about PDM making their own laws and not listening to Supreme Court?

Yeha bad choice of words here. "Playing with law and order and creating chaos".

I thought the US was pro democratic. Why blame the protestors for wanting their fundamental human right?

Should have thought a bit more about how to word it before sending. People out here protesting against a fascist government and military establishment to bring about true democracy is Pakistan yet all you can think about is how IKs arrest is creating chaos in Pakistan and it is somehow PTIs fault and not the corrupt jurnails due to which internet is being shut down in Pakistan

This guy is a total turd.

Wow. People like you bring shame to Pakistan’s name.
Pakistani people are fighting for democracy. There is only honour in that, rather than staying under a corrupt government that wasn’t even elected by the people.

For real though, should I warn some international friends against visiting the northern areas in August? Or will the situation have calmed by then?

I don't need to lie,’ Imran Khan says after ISPR rejects allegations



Former Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan is safely back in his home.



This warms my heart.

Amidst this celebration, never forget that 50 people were killed just because the government and military wanted to make a power play.

Remember still that several hundred people are still in jail on trumped up charges just because they exercised their constitutional right to protest.

This fight is not over. Far from it.

Alhumdulillah

Alhumdullilah ❤️❤️

Support

❤️ hero is back home

May Allah SWT protect him and his people. May Allah bring justice to the corrupt and cruel.

He looks so rough bro. Why is Pakistan like this 😭

Imran Riaz Khan

Does anyone else feel that they've killed him or paralyzed him perhaps. He's missing, no one coming forward, no sign of him, no one knows where he is. Almost like they're waiting for things to die down before it's announced or dump his body somewhere......

I dont think so….too much “international eyes” &amp; national heat underneath them. Dont think they will do anything to him. On the other side i have a bad feeling but let’s pray everything is ok with him and the other arrested/kidnapped 🤲.

People absorbed Arshad Sharif's tragedy because still, at the end of the day, he was abroad and there was no concrete evidence of anything.

If God Forbid Imran Riaz is harmed after everyone saw being taken into custody, days after IK's arrest and hard fought release, it will ignite a new wave of public mutinies I have no doubt

Let's all hope he's okay.

He will be tortured a lot but don't think they will kill him (slow/delayed poison is possible, allegedly he was poisoned before causing significant liver problems)

they can’t kill him, not yet anyway, they’re hiding him and trying to “update his software”

It's such a shame his own colleagues Haven't talked about that new pseudo intellectual guy who worked with him is making videos about how IK is a bigger threat than establishment but not gonna speak how his colleague is missing.

He was live on a Twitter space with Sabir Shakir and few others on Tuesday night.

Imran Khan arrested at IHC by Rangers



Removal Reason: A pinned megathread already exists on this topic.  Kindly continue your discussion there.

Welp ball’s in awaam’s court now.

If anything happened to IK asides from Pakistan army the person most responsible is Judge Aamer Farooq. One of the most corrupt Judges working with the Army.

Not surprising that this happened right after the ISPR statement.

Lunder one army

Boy they done fucked up

What a shambolic state of affairs our justice system is. Only the rich and corrupt ones are protected by it, while the people who raise their voices against them are adequately silenced.

Hope the justice prevails and Pakistan gets out of this mess.

*grabs popcorns and sits down*

When will Youtube, Twitter be unblocked?

Does anyone know when the government is planning to lift these stupid bans? Imran Khan is back, mobile network internet is back, so what exactly is the government waiting for now? 

It's been a fucking week and I can't believe how there isn't more uproar about this. It's 2023 ffs.

I guess they are handing down some sort of collective punishment for the masses because their fefe got hurt.

Probably Kal jab pta waly office jayan gay 😂

no news.

I've been wondering the same thing. I've been pretty busy the past few months and the moment I get to breath they shut down some of my main forms of entertainment... can't go out with friends either as we are all pretty tired.

Just use vpn bro

In 2014 the KPK assembly under PTI passed a resolution in favor of a Hazara province, why haven't they followed through?

This was one of Imran Khan's promises in the 2013 and 2018 elections, they passed the resolution in 2014 and doubled down with another one last year yet there has been no work on this? Is this another one of those empty promises of the PTI government? Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Imran Khan but have to hold him and his accountable for unfulfilled goals.

2014 resolution

[https://www.dawn.com/news/1094671](https://www.dawn.com/news/1094671)

2022 resolution

[https://tribune.com.pk/story/2337220/k-p-assembly-adopts-hazara-province-resolution](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2337220/k-p-assembly-adopts-hazara-province-resolution)

Creating a new province also requires parliament to pass a bill. Did PTI form the govt in 2013-early 2018? No. And then when they did form the govt in 2018 they didn’t even secure a majority. It was them + 12 other parties

Because after that every other ethnicity will start demanding their own separate provinces, which will lead to more de-centralized power structure, which will be very very detrimental to... 'National Interest'

I guess you guys shall have a little background study in to what situation breeds unrest in Hazarwal society, they're not pressing on for a separate province as much as South Punjab or Jinnahabad. 

Hazara region falls within KP Gov but is mistreated by Pashtun Majority reason. Having Mostly Agricultural yield and 70% of the tourist spots of KP, along with Tarbela Dam for Power generation. 
In KP gov jobs are quota based and are divided into 6 sectors, one of these sectors is Hazara, for every 24 Jobs that Rest of the Sectors are allocated, Hazara gets quota for 1. Same goes for other Social benefits and Gov funds allocation.  Having 38% Population in a Province, generating its 53% of the revenue and then getting benefits in odds of 1:24. That's what has been the motive of Hazarwal community, they prerer having rights more than a province. And the population itself is not pressurizing the Separate Province Per se. "Sooba Hazara" is not a separatist movement but an equal rights demand. 

Regardless of the movements Passed in KP assembly, you can not proceed for something that people do not want.

The problem is, you ned constitutional amendment, require 2/3rd majority. Secondly, people of Hazara are no longer actively asking for a province, people were fired up then and there but there is no political movement that is actively pursuing this.

It's just an election promise

If they are going to make Hazara, they might as well carve up Balochistan and unite all the pashtuns.

They said a lot of things. It’s called pushing a false and nationalist narrative to of course fool the masses

Must election non sense stuff , nothing concrete.

Provinces on ethnic lines, that should be a good idea. /s  It's 21st century, and Pakistanis are still falling for ethnic bs. If tthat logic went forward, North Balochistan will get separate province. DI Khan in KPK will get merged into Seraikistan and so on. Maybe Kohistan will demand their own province. Provinces should purely be administrative.

Hasn't hazara been divided Into abaseen division tho, how can a province be possible now or will it include the two divisions

🔴 LIVE | Chairman PTI Imran Khan's Important Address to Nation

100th "important address"

Let the downvotes commence...

He goes on ranting for hours. Can someone summarize (if any) new points. No bootlickers of PDM or PTI. Need honest news please.

Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif mocks the serious danger to 
@ImranKhanPTI's life and makes life threats directly from the parliament.



Khawaja Asif is an absolute parasite. He’s like this crow that caws aimlessly the whole day, shits on property and immediately bolts when slightly confronted. They always are on the lookout for easy meals. Any intelligence this man has is wasted on his pettiness towards PTI and sycophancy of the Sharif family.

Unremarkable when born, no use when alive and not memorable when gone.

These guys can’t even spell omelette.

Irony is that he's our defence minister

The arrogance and delusion of these people is on another level.

Typical crime boss.

By his logic if someone random shot him in the street it's his fault for having the audacity to be outside. Scum

Abhi ministry khatam hogi to ye video is ki dikhein ge

I would love to plays these back when they are runnings from people

Is this the ethics, haya, grace guy?

The sad reality is that many in the country believe the likes of Khaqan Abbasi, Khwaja Asif, Ahsan Iqbal, Sherry Rehman, Qamar Zaman Kaira etc are intellectuals. Sigh.

Madarchot

His threats aside, he himself just defeated his own point that the safety protocols are just drama. He himself laid credence to the fact that IK's life is in danger. What an idiot. Can't even think before speaking in the parliament of all places.

In a brave country, cr3atures like this would have faced Ceaușescu's fate.... but you never know - it's never too late!

Yes , Sit at home and Polish boots like us. Not a very hard decision to make!!!

I'm a total stranger to pakistani politics, just want to point out that this guy is using arguments that are identical to what some redditors said to me here on women's safety matters: "there are consequences to leaving your house and you are responsible for them if you go out". such an idiotic take by this MINISTER who is supposed to ensure nobody gets fucking shot in the streets

Didn’t see the life threat, and he is right that politicians usually have a higher risk of being assassinated or have attempts on their life. Many politicians have dealt with threats to their life but how ik acts is one of a kind its just plain cowardly , you didn’t see benazir wearing one of these when literally a bomb was blasted near her car during a rally the previous week. And to quote a hypocrite man,’cowards don’t become leaders’

I don't care who he is or whatever party he is from. I equally hate all of them. But he has a point. Imran Khan loves to play hero in front of media but does not have the guts to suffer actual hero shit. Yeah kudos to you for making brave choices but you're not a hero until you suffer the consequences of your choices. Brave choices ka ye mtlb nai k foran apko tamgha imtiaz de dia jayega. Alot of times and especially in our country jahan sara system he puppet show hai you have to be prepared for the worse. You cannot slap someone amd then cry when you're slapped back. It's not about playing fair. It's about common sense

Khawaja was personally targeted by Imran. So now he is in revenge mode

I can’t help but wish he is placed in same circumstances and realizes what he is seeing

I wonder where Khawaja Asif lives

Army’s tatta

PDM and Establishment is happy to get scalp of this Chohan chawal?

PTI ka Chohan PDM ka howa....lol

So here is the resume of Fayyaz ul Hassan Chohan:

* Ex-MMA
* Ex-PMLQ
* Buzdar's chaheeta (was fired 3-4 times from various minister roles but somehow Buzdar kept giving him new positions)
* Making controversial comments about Hindus
* Making derogatory remarks against Kashmiris
* Making chawal comments in a public gathering about our own film industry
* ... and much more

Better to build an army of AI robots than these cartoons... lol

So....how did Imran Khan allow him into PTI if he was that big of a moron?

This guy shouldn't have been included in the party in the first place. He needs to be put in school first and be taught basic manners and etiquette first. A clown he was and even a bigger clown now.

Maybe what elders used to say is right, sometimes god makes you go through some hardships for your own good. Its like a filter.

We do not know if he has really left or not though. I mean, this is just a media statement which hes said clearly under pressure.

Every MNA who voted against the Imran Khan government has been given development funds worth around 50 crores



This gov has money for everything except for elections. Btw remember IK used to say they sold their votes for 50 crore maybe this is that money?

Nice bribery.

It's really time now that we awam need to establish new or reform every single institute of the country.

What about non MNAs?.When will I receive my money,shabeez sharif? /s

Briyani also works lol

Khaata hai tou...lagaata bhe tou hai.

Democracy. This drama has been going ever since I can remember. People beg the MNA's to get their gali pakki in return of votes. I wish we had all such powers devolved to local government.

Every day my hate for the company grows more. Nowadays I even curse them in my prayers. I hope PDM &amp; especially their handlers meet a terrible end.

Oh you mean ‘developmental funds’.

This gov has money for everything except for elections. Btw remember IK used to say they sold their votes for 50 crore maybe this is that money?

50cr … so not even 3 AMG S-Class?

Each?

This is standard procedure, PTI did it too. Only gave development funds to only half of elected members of the provincial assembly in 2019. 

https://www.dawn.com/news/1457557

This practice is bad, members of assemblies are only responsible for policymaking and legislation, development funds should never be given to MPA and MNA. Instead development funds should be given to local governments and its administration, they are legally and constitutionally responsible for development not legislators. 

PDM and PTI with this respect are sides of exactly the same coin.

Sher to geedar nikla.

'I know more': Imran Khan on Hamid Mir's comments about Bajwa's Kashmir plan



If he knew more why didn’t he say or do anything? He was ready to give Bajwa another extension

Genuine question - Does the current army leadership hate Bajwa ? In my head, everyday they have to deal with some stupid shit Bajwa has said or done.

“The British High Commission in Islamabad is closely monitoring the situation.”

Just saw this letter from, apparently, The British High Commission in Islamabad. This was shared on Twitter. Does this have any relevance or significance?

You should know it mean actually nothing. PTI have tried to engage with international community but there are just muted responses mainly because they might be concern about human right but they are not concerned about PTI or action and repercussions of there supporters on 9th May.

OSP diaspora is weak. And aloof, but Fauj has given us all the incentive needed to engage and mobilize. No decent human being with sense of rule of law would want NAPAK Fauj abducting and torturing people.

Buhat ache, seek help from foreigners and regret it once they take over...

And special citizenship program for Nawaz and offspring  so that they can peacefully enjoy their wealth in UK. 


I will have respect if EU actually puts sanctions and forces Pakistan to conduct elections and remove military control.

Out of the loop: can some one provide an unbiased (as possible) account of what claimed basis Imran Khan was arrested on, whether he has been charged of anything, and what the next legal steps the Pakistani Gov will take regarding Imran Khan?

I am out of the loop and am trying to understand the situation better.

It’s amazing how nobody has actually answered your question and just sent angry responses. 

The case under which he was arrested (allegations, not proven yet): Malik Riaz was indicted under money laundering chargers in UK by UK courts. He had to send back something like 174m $ as part of that case. 

In Pakistan, during IK tenure, the cabinet approved a recommendation in a sealed envelope that nobody got to see. This meant instead of the cabinet actually reading the recommendation and voting, they were told nothing and just told to approve. The recommendation was that Malik Riaz would not send back the 174m$ (I don’t know remember exact number), instead the Supreme Court would assume that he had sent back the money and it had settled against some other money he owed the government in some other charges. So imagine he owed the government of Pakistan X$, Court “assumed” he had sent back the 174 m$ from uk, so his debt to Pakistan was erased and he kept the 174m$ in uk. 

(Links: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/03/pakistani-tycoon-malik-riaz-hussain-hands-over-pounds-190m-to-uk-authorities-nca-



Then a few months later a company by name of Al Qadir trust, whose board members were ik, wife bushra bibi and her friend Farah, received a very very large parcel of land somewhere in punjab worth billions for free for a “university” that didn’t exist or had like 3 students (edit: it’s 120) enrolled or something. 

The assumption is that this land was received by IK in exchange for settling the Malik Riaz matter of 174m$. 

Finally; the reason he was arrested is that for months now the court has been calling IK to come to court in this case to fight the case. He did not show up and kept making excuses. Not showing up when court asks is a matter under which you can be arrested. There was an actual warrant for arrest approved by courts, it was not a random grab. 

So you can agree or disagree with the case, etc. but all of the above you can google to confirm the facts. (Edit: I use the terms “facts”, these are not facts, just how I understand it. I suggest everyone google this and try to understand for themselves what’s going on). 

Edit: as someone pointed out I’m a paid pdm shill for sharing what I know. I wanted to add a disclaimer that obviously I’m a paid pdm shill so assess the above as you wish and feel free to point out where I’m wrong.

Basis of Arrest: Embarrassing Establishment in Jalsas

Charged with: Everything that could stick

Legal steps: Everything is legal in Corruption and war

Seriously?

PAK ARMY has been raping pakistan since 1947, this is nothing new to them.

Unfortunately for them, this time, they won't get away with it. The whole world is watching and for the first time, pak awam is showing some courage and balls and standing up. Wish they had done that before too... like any day since 1947, but better late than never, I guess. Even if you are 75 years late

Maybe the corruption charges are true but seriously if he's been dragged cause of those charges than it such a joke
Everyone here is corrupt tell me honestly when did they ever got dragged by millitary 
Even terrorists talibans and rapists were freed in this country but yeah IK won't get freed he'll be slapped by one case after another
Isn't that suspicious and obvious what they're trying to implement
Just think about zahir jaffar even a monster like him was freed in Pakistan but they all are fixated on imran khan  watch the video how they broke his wheel chair and 50 millitary personal dragged him out of court like he's some kinda monster

Bro there’s a whole mega thread and so many others. Even another one with the same question as yours. Stop being lazy and just scroll down.

Pakistani military has a [long history](https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/13d95wa/history_repeats_itself_prime_minister_huseyn/) of coup d'états and arresting Prime Ministers on fabricated charges. This is just another instance.

Only change is now Pakistan military gets to arrest a popular, former Prime Minister through a puppet regime it has complete control over. The charges, as usual, are fabricated. The motive is to keep him out of power and not hold elections.

No basis lmao ITS actually just bogus. They are just using the state but this time the youth is there.

You’re not going to get an unbiased answer here. 

He was arrested for not cooperating with or showing up to inquiries for the Al-Qadir Trust case. That case is essentially:

&gt;	The case relates to the illegal acquisition of land and construction of Al-Qadir University involving unlawful benefits given in the recovery of prime proceeds of 190 million British pounds through the UK’s National Crime Agency.

&gt;	The NAB said the former prime minister misled his own cabinet by concealing the facts and documents related to the settlement agreement.

&gt;	The money — totaling 190 million British pounds — was received under the settlement agreement and was supposed to be deposited in the national exchequer, say the NAB sources. However, that money was adjusted in another case settled by the Supreme Court against a payment plan of Rs460 billion.

The NAB issued the arrest warrant for: 

&gt;	The NAB said the arrest was made after fulfilling the lawful procedures of inquiry and investigation and that during the process of inquiry/investigation, several call-up notices were issued to the former prime minister and his wife but none of the call-up notices were responded to by them.

The IHC took notice of the arrest yesterday, and after hearing from both sides, [ruled that the arrest was legal](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2415863/ihc-rules-imran-khans-arrest-carried-out-legally). 

Basically, he’s accused of billions of rupees worth of corruption, refused to cooperate with the NAB who is investigating it, got arrested for it, now PTI and their supporters are trying to frame this as victimization and retaliation for Khan speaking out against the army.

They needed a reason so they brought up some old Al qadir university corruption case

Pakistan Army has ‘no link’ with Imran Khan’s arrest

https://www.geo.tv/latest/486523-pakistan-army-has-no-link-with-imran-khans-arrest

Ah yes, rangers are not army😋

yeah, rangers waale to WAPDA ke under hain?

Geo is a pdm mouthpiece, not a somewhere you go to get news

Sure we get it.

Army ki ammi ka link tha phir.

I just read on a dawn editorial that one of the security guys of IK, said he was former ssg, and the people who arrested were trained soldiers and not normal rangers.

Rangers are on sui southern's payroll 😆

Rizz levels off the charts.

Next time they will take all videos and pix of IK giving autographs to fans and claim that he bribed ppl to vote for him.

On a related note, young IK was gigachad AF 🤣. So this may also be a case of sour grapes as pmln has proclaimed multiple times that IK is loved by judges and estb coz their wives are infatuated with him lol. I think it was one of the khawajs who said that saad or asif lol. New level of being jealous LOL. fazlu also said something equally repugnant LOL. Its simple they hate him coz they ain;t him LOL.

If you are out protesting you need to write your name or number on your hands. So if anything happens people will know who you are.

Why did the Supreme Court only took action against the abduction of Imran Khan today on 11th May when Imran Khan was abducted 2 days ago on 9th May?

Why did the Supreme Court stay silent from 9th May till 11th May before saying anything? 

Did the Pakistani army tell Supreme Court to do it? 

Why Supreme Court not act on 9th May or at least 10th May?

technically the petition was filed yesterday, the court apparently only open midnight when its about kicking out IK lol

Pakistan Supreme court is very much affected by public pressure depending on who the Chief Justice (CJP) of the time is. For example the current CJP and his Justices buckled under the pressure of the Pakistani establishment led by Bajwa back in April '22 and was the same exact bench that sent IK home on technical grounds, the decision was correct but they clearly bent over backwards. CJP was always thought to be a establishment lackey and that night hit the nail in the coffin.  In the past year realizing that their (I think 8 Judges) decision on that day is the entire cause of this turmoil in the first place, after IK buckled and called elections and they over turned it. Since then almost all establishment planted judges have broken ranks as they see history is being recorded and literally everyone knows which judge will side with which side. So when people get out on the street and ef up everything they act. If people don't move they don't.Nawaz Sharif has over time infiltrated judges in the Supreme court which are under his control they form the other half of the 15. Since the establishment and NS are on the same page now the NS loyal judges are as well. The next CJP, previously thought to be a liberal and anti-establishment and has a corruption charge due on him and has gave all his decisions in favor of NS. Hence the current CJP trying his best to remember in good words by history to clean out his April '22 sh\*\*.  And he only has time till October before he retires. And Gov is not listening to him nor is the army, nor is the election commission(also a NS Lackey). It is a mess.  


EDIT: The Imran Khan decision only worked if there wasn't a previous precedent. Unfortunately there was, Where once elections are called there is no turning back. They had to blow that precedent in the water to achieve the April decision.

They saw public reactions

SC pretends to take such stands to keep up the cloak of justice, in reality, they are the Military's puppets, just for appearance to the outside world.

I don't think they could have done anything on 9th May.  Us ke liye suo moto lena parhna tha aur agar wo le letay to aur panga ban jana tha.

The PAK Army tainted all the the state institutions (including the courts) with their dirty hands, these lolipops are just for damage control, and they will try again by other means.. fake cases or just try to assassinate him again. They probably already posioned him when he was in custody.. they have a track record of doing the latter.

Imran Khan came out of high Court after Bail .



Why does he look dheela, Allah khair kare

Fuckin Chad.

No effect on the swagger. My man is a chad

Seriously looks like a fish market instead of high court. Why can't these so called police walay clear a simple way for him to move? Where is the order in this shit show?

any news abt imran riaz khan?

ive come across rumors that he is in coma and extremely serious, as well as his tongue has been cut off to prevent him from talking ya to make him a NISHAAN E IBRAT. this has saddened me to the core however im not sure if those rumors are actually true. lets all pray for his wellbeing and safety. ameen. allah humain in dollar ke bhookay kutton say nijaat day. ameen

They were supposed to present him to court at 4pm

They probably killed him and they’ll get away with it

His tongue has been cut off?? WTF

Rumors I seen on Twitter that he has been killed... It's a wait and see now

Not saying that they didn’t torture him but cutting someone’s tongue off doesn’t exactly prevent you from being able to convey thoughts and ideas. It just stops them from being able to physically speak.

How is the current political affairs new?

- We've had previous leaders also go against the military and have been killed or side lined (Nawaz Sharif, Benazir Bhutto, Bhutto). And some of these leaders also had huge public support.

- With some of the recent cases it shows that Imran Khan is pretty corrupt too. His net worth increased a lot while he was PM.

I just feel history is repeating and the army will eventually be able to side line Imran Khan, hold elections and get someone else as PM. How is this any different this time?

&gt; With some of the recent cases it shows that Imran Khan is pretty corrupt too. His net worth increased a lot while he was PM

This time 70% of the people support the party which is being sidelined.

This time people took to the streets.

This time Generals had to come on TV for the first time to defend themselves.

This time the army is holding rallies to gain some support.

This time soldiers are whining about people hating them openly.

This time they had to ban TVs and shutdown internet to attack PTI.

This time DGISPR is afraid of making a tweet because he is afraid of people bashing him under the tweets.

why are people simping for him?

Police beating up protestors and workers inside Imran Khan's house in Zaman Park.



If IK is on his way to Islamabad,what are are doing inside his house.

There should’ve no legal basis for it. 

PDM and establishment have one point agenda here antagonise IK and his supporters to brink of bloody clashes so that they can stop the elections.

Welcome to Purana Pakistan.

PDM shills, here is your opportunity to explain how this is epitome of democracy.

Look at what's happening in Islamabad.

They've barricaded the entrance from motorway toll plaza 

They'll let IK go through, but stop other vehicles and supporters. Jo Islamabad main hain they are already arrested. Signals also blocked in G11

And then when they've isolated IK they'll arrest him.

Ik should give a call for protest now and at least all of Islamabad should come out and go to G11 or d chowk. Actually d chowk because the whole of police is busy in G11.

No morals whatsoever, vandalizing someone's house despite clear orders from court. 

There is no law in this country.

Mulk Kay L lagay huay hain magr in kanjaron say yeh kara lo.

He's in Islamabad for a court hearing, a woman is alone at home, court has stopped any police op and he is on  jail, why do this.

Now they'll claim they retrieved weapons from the house.

They’ve planted some fake things like drugs/weapons/etc in his house, which they have taken as evidence. The plan is to declare IK and his party as terrorist like dirty Mary said in her talk. This country is literally done, sadly.

This is pure state terrorism.

They got their asses kicked by aam admi so this is them tryna show they are big strong men... by uh hitting his staff.

Kdhr hain ab saray bikaoo journalists Jo qanoon ka rr har waqt kartay thay?

Ya Allah, what has this come to…

Jahil

PTI has been leading and clean sweeping elections across country. They're trying to create chaos and emergency situation to delay/stop elections in Pakistan.

Well the goal of the police is to delay elections by creating clashes, this was meant to happen.

From the west to the east, no matter which country you are in. It's always fuck the police 🖕

This is beyond belief. How low they can go!

PDM and establishment want people to react so they can kill few and use emergency to stop elections. 

The judges of SC and High Courts are sleeping . I hated previous chief justices Iftikhar Ch and Saqib Nisar because of their excessive Suo Moro actions. But now I think we do need such a Chief Justice not current 🐈 l in office now. 

Another thing: 
nothing will happen to Sector commander Lahore and Police chiefs who are involved in this action. Even when PTI wins Lahore elections all these goons will be protected by judiciary and bureaucracy

The real Terrorists are in GHQ, this police and pdm are puppets.

Punjab Police is behaving like terrorists.

News is saying Islamabad being put under emergency.

This is just plain wrong, and no one should support this brutality by forces.

Bitches of the riches

Fascists.

Yeh Jo dehshat gardi hai iske peeche wardi hai.

Ab to is police ko dekh keh lagat ha ke yehi hamari sab se bari dushman ha.

What the hell is going. Unbelievable scenes in Zaman park

It's clear thing that it has become personal not just for Maryam but also for few of the generals and other beuracrats. Entire state machinery is being used to suppress just one political party and ordinary peoples are being trashed all around. No one is talking about inflation uncertainty in markets and other economic aspect which will hit us the hard.
Our economy is already failing and such action hinder any possible investment in Pakistan which we dearly needs. All about priorities and their is anything we can do about it.

Brave police. Coward bloody civilians. Bravest army.

go to a toy store and get as much padding and gear as you can

While I disagree vehemently with how IK handled this... this shit is on another level of disgusting. I hope all those protestors beat the shit out of them. I pray all of Lahore descends on them and teaches them a lesson.

Hopefully, people will soon realize they need to meet oppressors with force

1 year and Pakistan has collapsed politically, economically and what ever category you can think of

This incident makes me very angry. It’s just a game to PDM. But they are taking the country down a route to lawlessness.

You people are gonna remember PTM slogans soon :)

How will this end?

Vote on what you think will be the conclusion to the recent events starting from Imran Khans arrest on 9 May 2023.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/13doxvd)

While I do think IK and PTI will be disqualified,i dont think protests will stop until elections with PTI are held or we get martial law. People are sick of the army and they only have 2 options, give in to the peoples requests or rule with an iron fist. There can be no going back to the hybrid scheme

Martial law + IK getting death penalty for "trying to start mutiny" among the forces.

Army has been exposed big time. There is no going back to any "hybrid" regime now. They went from controlling every single administration behind the scenes while enjoying massive public support to representing the effing PDM and having majority of the country turn against them. This might be brutal but its the outcome we needed. 

They, along with their western backers will soon realise that there is no semblance of democracy anymore. Its either martial law or something else. Even the US cannot pretend to support martial law again.

IK getting disqualified which will likely lead to infighting among other PTI leaders.

Pti getting disqualified from elections is more probable than you can imagine.

Imran khan will be killed and as usual they will sacrifice someone that will make our nation happy. There will be bigger protests and eventually our daily news will be soaring prices of AATA &amp; CHEENI and this will be forgotten. 
Anchors will debate with their guests over Generals and Captains who once commited this act, as you hear about Musharraf. 
Always and forever zombie nation.

You fellow zombie

PTI disqualification will be the beginning of the Myanmar style all-out war against the oppressing army unless there is an internal mutiny against the top brass. Myanmar Junta jailed NLD chief and banned NLD... Now, the Junta an1\*ls are being exterminated by the droves and they have lost control of 50% of the country.

**The problem is the "brain in the knee" generals never learn from history let alone from its own history. M0nster Yahya thought that he could just subdue the bloody civilians by massacring 20-30 thousand Bengalis!**

- A lot of Deaths (already piling up), use spoilers to add more to choas
- PTI is disqualified, labeled terrorist party and split to create a new party
- IK dies slowly with disease
- KP choas continues, Pashtuns blood would as easier for them ([4 Killed, 91 injured in Peshawar.](https://www.dawn.com/live/pakistan)
- Rest will be controlled and ppl will move on

IK is released with new and improved software.

military dictatorship

My prediction:  
\-PTI banned   
\-Pervez Elahi and SMQ forms their own PTIs. Pervez doing what he joined PTI for. To break it.  
\-Elections called as soon as PTI divided into 2 parts  
\-IK released after election

Even with the senior PTI leadership over, theres a chance

Everyone knows that most senior PTI leadership or the heavyweights like shireen mizari are forced to quit. It seems like its damaging but lets not forget PTI is not a political party, its a PERSONALITY CULT. We had useless asswipes like aamir liaquat win on imran khan tickets, the heavyweights leaving doesnt affect the party’s vote-bank significantly, in hindsight it also had the party get rid of a lot of nonamers lotay leaving room for newer faces to get tickets.
In the grand scheme of things, nothing goes futile. Last year the party needed old school lotays because they had their own vote bank, they served their purpose and now the party is a household name and if the same turncoats leave now it doesnt change anything.
Last lets not forget that there wasnt going to be a revolution in IKs life time, and that IK is not a messiah, he did his part by pushing the movement one step forward. There will be more that will come every second decade(or more frequently hopefully), revolutions take a long time- to gain momentum.

That is true. At the very least, the misconception that the army itself is not involved in corruption is completely over. They are completely okay with and in fact have facilitated corrupt leaders that they can control.

The good thing now we have a whole generation/gen-Z that hates bajwa and company. A whole generation jiske L*n pe hai alpha bravo charlie

It's aint over till the fat lady sings

Only revolution will come when you idiot kids take a stand and decide not join lumber one. Can you guys do that? Well?

Gosh you people really thing these "statements" mean anything. There is nothing stopping them from communicating with IK off the grid. There are far more encrypted ways of communicating e.g. Vpn, Signal - better version of whatsapp, go figure.

Imran Khan’ Arrest was False Flag

I am sure this was all false flag operation by intelligence/army to check the public sentiment, they did it to check the outcome.

Not really. 

People said the same thing when there was an assassination attempt. 

These are not false flag operations (for reference, you are using the term ‘false flag’ incorrectly here. It is not what you think it means). 

They fully intended to kill Imran then. They fully planned to keep him in confinement this time.

If he is free now, it is because the people came out to protest against it.

People massively overestimate how competent the Pakistani army is. 

Except for Zarb-e-Azb, I’ve never actually seen or read about a plan of theirs that didn’t backfire.

Whether that’s the 71 war, Bhutto’s hanging, Kargill, entering the soviet-afghan war or the American-afghan war. Their history is one of failure and unintended consequences. 

Unless of course their plan is short term gain for long term suffering. In which case, they are really good at their job.

And they decided that the reaction wasnt as bad cause Punjab Police is out to arrest IK from IHC

We love conspiracy theories !

You are assuming that they are intelligent enough.  
They are not. They are bunch of dumbfucks. All these things they do which are causing these reactions, they actually thought this would work in their favor.

Is Punjab Police Even Pakistani's ?

Recently a lot of videos are circulating regarding the cruelty of punjab police, they are doing all the worst things possible torturing women and man handling the minors and elderly, what is this ? from where the people in punjab police came from ? this is not even the people of Karachi or KPK that you can say they are just being racist this is their own people of the same city they don't even have the decency to just arrest and neutralize the protestors they are straight up torturing/harassing and physically beating them, even women and minors.

&gt;Is this the true face of Pakistan's Establishment ?  
&gt;  
&gt;So people were right at the time of partition that extremist choose to go to Pakistan and people who want's to stay stayed.

It does not take a Sherlock to figure out now that this whole Pakistan thing was only so the few can loot millions of population. Our leaders who originally envisioned what Pakistan should be was killed , kidnapped or disappear, why does not anyone from Quaid-e-Azam's family is even in politics while in India all the Gadhi family members are still practicing politics.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Imran Khan is really a wrecking ball to PDM and Establishment he is the man that Pakistan needed so badly, yes he is not perfect he has flaws but the man have some serious guts and admiration to throw away his luxurious life just to be dragged like a criminal on the streets just because he demanded for people's right.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;PDM and Establishment bootlicker's don't try to justify your corruption and terrorism with your 10 dollar speech with in a Brioni suit, if you want to give opinion first buy the phone/computer/car/internet/house/clothes with your own money than try to justify otherwise you are just a submissive cunt to your ancestors wealth, you are nothing at your own worse than a earth worm.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Lastly to all the brave "PROTESTORS" especially "WOMEN" you all are doing great history will remember all of you as the revolutionary.**

they are as Pakistani as Pakistan itself. as Pakistani as you or me. or as Pakistani as Imran Khan himself. only difference is they are uneducated, placed in a position of power, and forced to see and know nothing but their own struggles. when poverty is so ripe you have no choice but do your job in order to feed your family. this is what the army and politicians have created in 70 years. when you have no education or skill, I guess you sell your morality for food on the table.

The problem is the people who made Pakistan ( educated Urdu speaking ) from North India , Lucknow , Delhi etc were a small minority compared to large Sindhi , Punjabi population. 

So the uneducated people gained power while those cultured educated Urdu speaking became marginalized because the population was small

no they're just greedy

Are PTI supporters Even Pakistan's?

Imran Khans Message To All Pakistanis 🚨🚨🚨

May Allah protect and safeguard Imran Khan and supporters, amen.

Wait so police have come many times, whats different this time?

All the statist Noonies and Pipliyas who are craving for his blood had parents who did the same when army came to arrest Mujeeb.

Don't be angry at them. They can't help themselves. It's deep within their generational DNA to lick the boots.

if u want to save #pakistan then every #Pakistani needs to get out of their homes and march towards #GHQ. Take down the masters within #GHQ and free #Pakistan right now

Given the scenes from Zaman Park, it appears like the regime will repeat a Model Town style massacre in order to get Imran Khan.

It seems the city of lahore is a dead city. 13+ million people and you can't get a 1000 people to come out lol. When martial law comes people will still be sleeping.

People need to come out on the streets, this is your future at stake. If you let them win now, just wave goodbye to the country.

If they arrest IK, 75 years of "independence" was a waste, might as well have stayed with India. We never were a nation, nor did we ever care to build one.

It reminds me Allende, Chile's elected president was surrounded by Pinochet's soldiers.  He gave one last and most impressive speach in defense of democracy.

Allah help us!  Allah save Imran!

They're gonna kill him aren't they

What ppl need to wake up to is that this isn’t about Imran, it’s about anyone else besides these two fascists families who would dare to stand up to them, it’s about anyone who would demand accountability and a rule of law. if you live in pak and care about your children and a future where you are not in a sham democracy and will be forced to live in hopelessness you need to speak up, you need to protest because at the moment no one else in politics speaks for most of the nation

# Military Inc never tolerated any popular civilian leader ever- they brutally destroyed every single one of them. IK won't be any exception unfortunately. They didn't even hesitate to commit genocide and split the nation just to keep their accountability-free above-law status. 

# There is no hope of light in this endless dark tunnel!

&amp;#x200B;

#

I've never ever protested in my life or even considered it. Basically been against it and never been to one of his "dharnas" even though close family has but if something happens to him, even if they don't kill him, i doubt that I'll still have that sentiment.

For every one asking whats diff this time

Call for a Revolution!

I don’t like him , but if something happens to him I will be mad

The people should do an "Occupy GHQ protest" like the non-violent "Occupy Wall Street" protest.

Hopefully would instill some fear of the people in Jurnail Hafiz e Quran.

Bibi was killed it was hell for a few days then now years later nobody cares or gives a shit, the sames gona happen to him if it goes this way

May Allah send infinite Peace and blessings upon Prophet Muhammad(Peace Be Upon Him) “ﷺ” and His family and His friends. Ameen sum ameen.

And man, idk whats gonna happen to this country tbh

I never liked him but this is not the way .

Bro, call it a conspiracy or whatever you wanna call it,  but we can clearly see whats going on. The whole MNA fiasco. They Got bought for 15 crores and disappeared. Do you guys even know why Imran Khan was ousted. How did they manage more votes  in the national assembly. They removed our PM and brought a new one, just like that. Easy peasy loophole, oust anyone by law in the form of the democracy we have. They dont want the democratic process, one that empowers the nation. They dont want a pure dictatorship as well as that also makes a nation mighty. Say what you want iraq(saddam) and libya(gaddafi) were regional powers to reckon with. Zia in pakistan effectively carried out guerrilla campaign against super power soviet union and they had nuclear weopens in the 60s. They sent a guy near to the moon first. Wht did we have? Some borrowed fighter planes. Stinger missiles, tanks? Yet our army and intelligence had it in them to fight proxy wars and even become one of the causes of dismantling the super power soviet union (by ofcourse by playing over the battleground of Afghanistan, they had there own fucked issues due to this even worst than ours leading upto the war in Afghanistan as well but thats another thing, but we helped millions of them so there is that as well). They then blowed up Zia's plane as well. What do they actually they want with us? I'll tell you. To become Something weak and pathetic. Empty even, if they could they'd want this land devoid of all life! Wht is there in Afghanistan. What do you think they accomplished by blowing Libya, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, Jordan, Palestine. Buying off Israel, Saudia, egypt. What do all of these countries have in common? Dont you dare say Oil !

Does anyone know about project blue beam? What was covid-19? It was A Test run and mass media manipulation on a world wide scale. Nocebo effect gripping the lives of Billions. Where is corona virus now? Just search for it on google and see the news about it. Why didn't it evolve into an ever dangerous mutation and the vaccine declared the only saviour. Look up how many people worldwide got the vaccine. Only 4 percent of the People in Yemen were vaccinated, same in Haiti, are all the people there dead now? North Korea started vaccinations on sep of 2022. Covid occurred in mass scale at the end of 2019. We had Lockdowns in 2020. Apparently Some single super spreaders gave covid to hundreds of people. Thats only one person we are talking about. Is the whole of North Korea Nation now dead?

They can play us like a fiddle. They want the whole world weak and pathetic for the upcoming wars. They want no one to succeed. And with all the infighting in our nation I think its becoming very difficult for us to contemplate that.

Imran Khan is I guess in this 70s now and when I think of him and Pakistan I feel terribly sad, as after him there is no one for Pakistan at all. If anything ever happens to him Pakistan will be left for the wolves to tear apart.

Here comes the cult member

Dressed up for war like zelanski!

Been up half the night in the UK watching this with growing fear.

British-born &amp; bred Pakistani Pashtun. Anyone who can't see Imran Khan is the best man for Pakistan, is beyond help.

We Pashtuns don't forgive &amp; forget, there will be carnage if he comes to harm.

Spineless civilians can’t even protect there leader ! Shame on all of them who are in lahore and sitting at home

My man wearing a $100 t shirt

Bro easy ho ker arrest day tu shaaba. 

Ghabrana nai hai sher.

Asking people to "fight for the rule of law" while evading arrest for not showing up in court 😂 The irony ffs

He has proven himself to be a real geeder, become a shair and follow the law, don’t use your cult to become a human shield for you, chooha-i-azam

Nothing will happen. The pakistani pple arent in a position to fight. Especially against the powers that rule and their supporters. Bigger powers at play here.

So, didn't the court dismiss Imran Khan's warrant. Since I am watching the video 6 hrs later.

English translation ?

tldr: who wants him arrested? why is he getting arrested? on what grounds is he being arrested for?

Violence is the only solution left?

When the organisations refuse to obey courts then there is no one to implement the law and when there is no law it chaos.

So in my opinion violence is the only solution left

Always was, always will be.

Unfortunately yes. We are on the verge of a revolution and there has never been a revolution in history without bloodshed. No one should be urged to do it, violence is terrible but sadly it gets inevitable

Violence helps, killing helps even more, unless it's happening to me, then it's wrong. 

A motto of the powerful and rich.

Civilian Alliance for civilian supermacy was thwarted by establishment using the likes of Imran Khan and Tahir ul Qadri.

After Musharaf a two party system was setting in. It got derailed by bombastic propoganda campaign against 'All politicians'.

After 100 years since Jinnah's demand for provincial autonomy, 18th amendment was finally made to ensure democratic devolution. A good step but it was not enough, the establishments jor tor made already insecure people in power even more insecure. Nascent constitutionalism and democracy was crushed by PAT and PTI protests.


Our country with a history of political instability, has faced numerous challenges to its democratic development since 2014.
One significant indicator of democratic backsliding in Pakistan is the politicization of the judiciary. Since 2014, there have been several instances where the judiciary's independence and impartiality were compromised. The removal of judges and their replacement with more favorable ones by the ruling party raises concerns about the erosion of the separation of powers. For example, the controversial removal of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry in 2014 and subsequent appointments of judges perceived to be aligned with the ruling party undermine judicial independence.

Media Suppression that We all celebrated this as this was happening in Immis time.

Another crucial aspect of democratic backsliding in Pakistan is the increasing suppression and censorship of media outlets critical of the government. Journalists, bloggers, and activists have faced harassment, threats, and even violence for expressing dissenting opinions. The use of legal provisions and pressure tactics to silence critical voices demonstrates a shrinking space for freedom of expression. Notable examples include the forced closure of Geo News, Pakistan's largest private news channel, in 2014, and the harassment and intimidation of journalists covering sensitive issues.

You have no idea how Tehsil dars ensured a win for PTI by pre poll rigging.

Elections are a cornerstone of democracy, and any interference that undermines their fairness and credibility indicates democratic backsliding. Since 2014, there have been numerous allegations of electoral manipulation and intimidation in Pakistan. Opposition parties have accused the ruling party of gerrymandering, voter suppression, and using state resources to influence electoral outcomes. The controversial 2018 general elections, marred by allegations of rigging and manipulation, further raise concerns about the erosion of democratic norms and practices.


Sadly there has been a gradual erosion of civil society space since 2014. The passage of restrictive laws and regulations, such as the Cybercrime Act in 2016, has curtailed freedom of association and stifled civil society organizations critical of the government. Additionally, harassment and restrictions on human rights defenders, including the enforced disappearances of activists, further contribute to the weakening of civil society.

We can't accept people as valid and responsible, all we see is an enemy on a person who does not share our views, democratic backsliding can be observed through the concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals or institutions, which limits political pluralism and competition. In Pakistan, there has been a trend towards the consolidation of power within the ruling party since 2014. The use of legislation and executive authority to curb political opponents, such as the disqualification of opposition leaders and the arrests of opposition figures on corruption charges, indicates a shrinking political space and undermines democratic principles.

 Also there is a class element and a domicile element to PTI, they see all those who support other political ideas as inferior. These can be seen in the terms like Patw*ri and the idea that is constructed the Sindhis are brain dead voters of PPP and MQM supporters do not have any grievence or political aspirations. Also calling Pashtun Tahafuz Movement as terrorists and celebrating Baloch missing persons.

Project Imran Khan has been a front of establishment and a representation of privileged classes of Pakistan.

Didn't they form like 4 govts in 80s/90s. The same 2 parties?

Damn, it's like mice are waking up from winter.

I love how this post arbitrarily connects random stuff  that happened in 2014 (and afterwards) with the PTI/PAT protests where Imran Khan had inceptively only asked for a recounting.

&gt;After Musharaf a two party system was setting in. It got derailed by bombastic propoganda campaign against 'All politicians'.

oh no.. not the sacred two party system 

Imran tried to take PPP and PMLN back to back to back (forever) away from us!!!! 

&gt;controversial removal of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry in 2014 and subsequent appointments of judges perceived to be aligned with the ruling party undermine judicial independence.

Acha CJP ko Imran Khan ne hataya tha

&gt;Notable examples include the forced closure of Geo News, Pakistan's largest private news channel, in 2014, and the harassment and intimidation of journalists covering sensitive issues.

Ji.

Geo ko tou Tahirul Qadri ne personally band karwaya tha na? 

&gt;You have no idea how Tehsil dars ensured a win for PTI by pre poll rigging.

Tou chalo aap bata do na.. Evidence provide kardo.

Magar aap tou “you have no idea” pe ruk gaye 

&gt;The controversial 2018 general elections, marred by allegations of rigging and manipulation

Exactly. 

Like when RTS came down and PMLN/PPP suddenly had far more seats when it started working again? 

Or when Khawaja Asif called Gen Bajwa to help him win? 

&gt;The passage of restrictive laws and regulations, such as the Cybercrime Act in 2016, has curtailed freedom of association and stifled civil society organizations critical of the government

2016 me kiski government thi?

&gt;Also there is a class element and a domicile element to PTI

The party which has popular support across social classes in all of the provinces apparently has a “class/domicile element” to it. 

I think you should have added the humour flair to this thread.

&gt;Project Imran Khan has been a front of establishment and a representation of privileged classes of Pakistan.

This is like.. I can't even.. Is it 1st April already?

Nice to read more voices of reason coming out of the woodwork lately.

Its part of the whole picture; this is a phenomenon that became visible after 1977, when the Establishment started deciding which politicians it could use to derail the democracy process to suit their own agenda.

Go back around 4 decades ago and see how Nawaz Sharif rose to power. Only to have his party hamstrung after the formation of the PML-Q.

See what they did with PPP; they were arguably at least as popular as PTI right now.

The figures and the party changes, but those at the helm are more or less the same.

Don't expect this to change anytime soon. As long as they keep themselves relevant, civil supremacy won't happen anytime soon. The best the civilians can do is bide their time and let things take their natural course.

Too long to read, but is it zardari or Nawaz turn to dance for the jaurnails?

Brother u r seriously seriously misinformed or are too young.
PPP was created by establishment to help ease it's indirect rule after realizing direct rule was not possible, all parties were against ayub Khan in 1965 and yes mujib ur Rehman supported Fatima Jinnah. 

As ayub khan reign was getting weaker and about to crumble the boys held onto another inside young boy , zulfuqar Ali Bhutto ( former foreign minister of president ayub Khan, helped in operation Gibraltar, changez Khan and grand slam along with general akhtar).

1971 elections won by Awami league but yahya Khan postponed NA session 3 times and then ordering operation " SEARCH LIGHT".
After commiting genocide of east Pakistan in 1970-1971 bcz boys couldn't rule there, 90k boys surrendered due to fear of indian troops and mukhti bani.

Fast forward,Bhutto and new army chief formed a commission to find failure of war but the commission led by chief justice homodur rehman found each tooth and nail of the genocide. It's report was never made public bcz Bhutto and coas feared it would shatter the morale of soldiers.

Fast forward Bhutto was becoming stronger so they hanged him.

Fast forward even more, benazir, zulfuqar Ali bhutto's daughter got too famous and followed in the footsteps of his father. To counter her coas formed pml-n. Nawaz sharif was the then Imran Khan of his era.

Fast forward Musharraf happened and fucked pml-n and ppp as they were both cornering establishment. 

The then Chief justice SAEED UZ ZAMAN was kidnapped and replaced by currently JUSTICE Irshad Hassan Khan who allowed Musharraf to change constitution without needing anyone else. Musarraf was made the god on earth (of Pakistan).

We were fucked long long before. PTI, PPP and PML-N all work for the boys. Whenever boys fire a party it barks till it gets to eat the shit of boys again on a payroll.

Imran Khan, Malik Riaz and the Al Qadir Trust Case



why does anyone listen to this guy?

who listens to this nut case?

He is a chuntiyan

Confirmed: Live metrics show that Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are now restricted across Pakistan amid the arrest of former PM Imran Khan; the incident is likely to limit freedom of assembly and the public's ability to seek information.

male police manhandeling female protestors

I believe everyone has already seen the videos going around of policemen/rangers manhandeling women protesters in the most disgusting manner. I just find it weird ke when Imran khan made ill remarks about maryam nawaz's marriage in his may 2022 jalsa plus when his video clip of rape victim blaming, taken completely out of context, went viral, Maryam Namaz used these against him for the longest time. And now even after all these clips going around of police physicaly harrasing women, she's all quite and hasn't yet said a single word about it. This isn't about Imran khan or anything just that its sad seeing these guys are allowing women to be treated like this just because of raising their voice agaisnt the establishment. I shouldn't be wishing ill on anyone but man do I hope karma strikes her and all involved in the harshest way possible.

Remember the outrage in the feminist circles when Imran made even one remark on hijab. When they come out to protest, everyone was praising them for it and now suddenly protests involving the state of Pakistan are not fit for women. Goes to show how much money is put into these organizations

Bangladesh Police: : "Hold my beer"

imran khan didn't make any wrong remark maryam the witch kept calling his name, also abou t the hijab his reasoning was to reduce temptation in the society

Well, it's jihad. There are going to be sacrifices.

The world should be seriously worried about what is happening in Pakistan now. Those who used the Army to remove Imran Khan from power have pushed a country with 165 nuclear bombs without anyone in control.



PDM are a bunch of idiots. They have no control.. the real power comes from GHQ. 

The army will still remain as strong as before, with or without imran khan, and will also continue to interfere in politics. We are just seeing the wrap up of "project Imran".

There’s that usual nuclear BS again.

This indian guy cant be trusted just pushing the “nukes aren’t safe narrative” they forget the day someone was dealing with some stolen uranium in their country

People always trot this out.  The nukes are safe.

That can’t be said about the common man…. Who since the founding have given their all and have yet to receive their fair share.

Former Iraqi MP explains politicians. Im A pro pti but again one man (IK) Can not change our corrupt nature. In his government minstr were the same lottay who once joined pmln or PPP. Sure Imran Khan didn't do any corruption, what about the rest of 99.9%. Everyone is corrupt and rotten to the core.



The problem is that Naya Pakistan meant installing a new culture in Pakistan and creating a transition that will realistically take 20ish years if not more. But if we continue on that path, then that's progress.

The rot is so deep, it extends not just to politicians but to the bureaucracy as well. I'm forced to think of Shabbar Zaidi who was essentially forced out of the FBR because senior officials within the FBR realized that they would be in serious trouble. (One of the things I'm upset with IK about; he didn't offer enough support to Zaidi...then again, this is just my reading of the situation. It's possible Zaidi was a nutjob who needed to leave)

While you are right ppl who want to commit corruption will commit corruption regardless of whose party they belong to. 

PTI is better because they actually do something about it. in 3 years they recovered more corruption money than was recovered by previous 3 administrations combined over a 17 year period. 

https://www.dawn.com/news/1692263

What I'm saying is you and ppl who think like you are wrong. Because despite COVID19, Pakistan experienced fast economic growth. 



You can complain about the lotay but I bet you, you would want to have PTI incharge when calamities like like COVID-19 and floods occur, when shit hits the fan u want actual leadership in place that is competent enough to deal with these issues

PPP and PMLN have been campaigning on jailing the others for corruption for years, yet nothing happened during their tenures. Sure catching ones own corruption is not going to happen but at least dont let your opponents get away with corruption. During PTIs tenure, corruption cases were pursued for both corrupt parties and corrupt elements under PTI like JKT and Aleem Khan were removed from the party when they got exposed. If it werent for the establishment saving these corrupt mfers, they would have been tried and jailed already.

This isnt a fairytale where IK can just gather a team of a thousand clean politicians out of nowhere and be able to get into power, let alone run a country with corruption running through its institutions core. 

The system will need to change and develop from the inside as better people enter the system and the corrupt ones die off. Idiots peddling the Sem-2-Sem bullshit have no alternative and in their nihilism are dooming the country further by not supporting the least worst option. 

Sure PTI is not clean, but its 100% better than PMLN, PP or any of the other PDM parties. If everyone in Pakistan starts voting for PTI on the basis of abandoning dynasties and corruption, then the other parties will have no choice but to improve themselves over PTI to get back into power. PPP and PMLN were a corrupt duopoly. PTI has actually forced them to compete or become irrelevant. Ur not a genius for figuring out that some politicians in a PTI might be corrupt. PTI supporters already know this. We are just trying to raise the stand of corruption which is acceptable in the country while "neutrals" just give up by saying nothing will change and Pakistan is doomed

Was there a time without major corruption since 47? 

Honestly we need totally new political institutions and purge the corrupt people out (basically all) in my opinion

The most important thing for a nation to stand up against it's institutions is education and knowledge, Our institutions are fully aware of this which is why every now and then we get patriotic songs and movies and tv dramas that "remind" people how great the army is and what they do is "for" the people. The nazis did the same but to a whole new level with an entire ministry dedicated to propaganda  which can be said about the ministry of IT but I highly doubt our establishment uses it since they've got their own budget and people to assist them.

Reminds me of PPP's “Kya corruption pe hamara haq nahi hai?”

If any of his ministers did any corruption, PDM (with the entire might of all intelligence agencies behind them) would've already built a good case and convicted them already. It would've been a landmark victory for PDM

Forget conviction, the fact that they havent even been able to *build* a legible case for a SINGLE PTI provinical minister (let alone a federal minister) puts this bullshit theory of "IK's men are corrupt" to rest.

It's a valid point but it doesn't reflect reality. Improvement comes at a steady pace and in incremental steps. You have to go through these small improvements before you start to see big gains. Choose whatever is slightly better at every chance and I believe PTI is that small improvement at this stage.

KULLU HARAMKHOR SHABAB KULLU KULLU, great video to reflect upon.

I want to present a view into our current political situation, Whether you like IK or not, one things is true with the events that unfolded after his removal, the Veil came off from the eyes of the ppl of Pakistan about the true nature of our Military Establishment. the real enemies of Pakistan and that alone is an accomplishment in itself, so now we need to take the path that fixes things In'Sha'Allah. 

IK himself is not corrupt ppl around him all have a ? on them there is no argument there but is there anyone Insane enough to dare change the system or even try to put a dent in it ? 

that is the true question.

Everyone is not corrupt. People who are corrupt think everyone is corrupt, which is their justification for being corrupt.

The vast majority of people are not corrupt because the vast majority are private citizens who do business or work for private businesses.

Speaks volume on how much faith these corrupt men have on the normal citizens, that they won't revolt.

Just make IK prime minister with 3/4 majority. Change the parliamentary democracy to Presidential democracy and the see the results

Only Imran Khan and Buzdar are not Corrupt

Have said the same thing that IK maybe is not corrupt but his team is filled with "lotay" and Corrupt people (still better than PDM)

Got banned and downvoted as much as I could in another Pakistani Red

Vice: Imran Khan when confronted about the censoring and targeting of Journalists during his term and the possible dismantling of either NAB or Army to bring balance in power. (Full interview link in the comments)

I hate these interviews done by the western media. 

In an attempt to conduct a seemingly fair interview, they ask him pointed questions such as What about corruption charges against you and the mountain of cases  you're facing. 

To a western viewer, it would appear that IK indeed is somewhat corrupt afterall he has so many cases against him. Whereas we all know as Pakistanis that these are politically motivated cases.

A great quote the encompasses my feelings is 

"If someone says it's raining, and another person says it's dry, it's not your job to quote them both. Your job is to look out the f**king window and find out which is true." -Sally Claire

Then he did disservice to all of us by singing praises of Bajwa and giving him an extension during his PMship.

Western media makes it a point to show a nationalist figure of a foreign country in the worst light when they dissent against American interests.

Full interview : [https://youtu.be/yO6Hei2TGk4](https://youtu.be/yO6Hei2TGk4)

I voted for this man. But I'm going to call him out here. This is a lie. 

He did censor journalists, perhaps not directly, but he enabled the DHA-Army CEO to do it. He passed laws criminalising the criticism of the DHA Armed Forces and those very laws were used to suppress the PTI when CEO Bajwa decided that he no longer needed Khan. 

Imran needs to learn from his mistakes. The DHA Armed Forces need to be made subservient to his authority and not equal stakeholders in power. 

And we the citizens need to enable him (Khan) in achieving this by boycotting the armed forces. I know I say this a lot, but the more this message gets out there, the better.

I watches the full interview.he did give a great answer on Uyghur situation and Taliban for watch it

Lmao even her mother crushed on him.

In the same interview she called him a babe magnet. 

Pretty fair interview to be fair. Isobel went easy on him all things considered and if anything she was a little in awe of him.

In this interview, he also discussed the Russian-Ukraine War, the Prosecution of Uyghur Muslims, Feminism, why his cabinet has the worst female representation, High rate of corruption during his term, and if he regrets being Pro-Taliban in the past (Spoiler : He is still Pro-Taliban SURPRISE SURPRISE!!!)

Honestly one of the most crappy interviews. The mans life is at risk and she has the audacity to ask such baseless questions

Trumper vibes in the comments. 

The collective amnesia ya'll are suffering from? It's gonna be a violent whiplash back to reality when you go back and look at IKs *actual* stance, and not the political jargon he throws to defend himself in front of journalists not on PTIs media payroll. 

Also; insert kutta/Tommy joke.

Fuck these interviews. Holy shit what ignorant pieces of shit and more shit fucking Kuttas.

Chad CJP !!!

Why is he upset with SCP upholding the constitution? Its literally written in constitution to conduct elections within 90 days.

God these people are so disingenuous.

What am I looking at and why is he crying about it?

Guys the guys name on the bottom right 💀

Edit: when i typed his name
Out my comment was removed by auto mod… its his name i was just repeating it lol.

Gloves are off and PDM lifafas are out. PDM deliberately refused to provide the money required, good luck with contempt of court

People's parliament without the most popular party and an opposition leader begging for election ticket from PLMN? What a fucking joke this guy is. Those lifafas  semt to him must be heavy.

Lets rephrase that because 3 crooks have sabotaged a country of 23 crore people and are delaying the elections to solidify their hold. So far, they have done nothing about the rising cost of living, deteriorating economy, and rising terrorism. 

Instead, they have done everything in their power to abrogate the constitution, give themselves a free ticket out of jail, and save their own skin. 

Matiullah Jan is a shitty journalist who makes posts like these and then cry when someone calls him out. Little bitch.

They are going to declare that bill unconstitutional and needs 2/3 parliament to pass. Then gonna charge a few people for contempt the next day. LOL

☝🏽these journalists have to decide whether they are with Sicilian mafia or constitution…..

The two sellout/henchmen judges (Yahya Afridi and Jamal Mando Khel) and the two blackmailed judges (Mansoor Ali Shah and Atar Minullah) are not in the bunch, which means there wont be a split decision this time.

Phar do pdm ko

Man everyone does long marches now a days, these marches fix nothing. We need actual action, not even jailing these current leaders would suffice, they will just feign illnesses and move to a different country like nawaz. Best solution is put a bullet in their head and end the story

Can someone please translate? What's going on? What's this?

Again no inclusion of QFA, Yahya Afridi, Tariq Mansood, Mansoor Ali Shah, Mandokhail, Minallah.

This lot undermines the constitutional power of CJP.

What people's parliament? It's for the thugs and thieves, not the common populace.

It's time we realize that PTI is only a few degrees better than PDM.

# First of all, I must re-iterate that I am no PDM shill and have supported PTI along with my family my entire life. I've grown up going to Khan's jalsas and listening to his speeches. I will vote for him in the elections too, because I see his party as the lesser evil.

***My argument is simple:***

IK made a party which he said will be the icon of accountability and *ehtesaab:* Pakistan Tehreek e **Insaaf**. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **In his own tenure and before that, I believe he betrayed his own principles by including ex-PPP and ex-PMLN people in his party.**

Literally, the whole base of MNAs and MPAs of PTI are the same old waderas, sardars, land grabbers, mafias, crooked businessmen who used to be in PPP and PMLN. They did not change under him. Aleem Khan, Sheikh Rasheed, Jehangir Tareen, the Khokhar brothers in Lahore, the Chaudhrys of Gujrat. These are all known corrupt people and part of the "mafia" that IK said he would dismantle.

&amp;#x200B;

* **He did not pursue the policy of radical change aka inqilaab that he promised.**

Even if Bajwa and army controlled him (he made this an excuse for his lack of delivery on his promises in a Vice interview. You can watch it [here](https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7zqvw/imran-khan-exclusive-interview-politics-pakistan)), **he could have still delivered on education and administrative reforms. They literally can be done on current budget without decreasing the army's budget or smth.**

He did not deliver at all on these. His Single National Curriculum (SNC) was a complete failure. It is no different from the old textbooks and does not reform the "rote learning" system we have. I have done O and A levels and been through their curriculum and believe me, it would take only a few dozen experts a few months to craft the entire curriculum according to international standards. Spending 50-60 billion, he could've easily trained sarkari teachers on modern learning methods in order to teach students to think critically and innovate. BUT HE DID NOT.

* **He did not improve the accountability situation in Pak at all.**

Self explanatory. Talked a lot about being firm on not giving an NRO to Nawaz. But in the end, Nawaz was allowed to leave the country for London and court cases against PMLN and PPP leaders failed.

**Corruption increased in his tenure compared to previous PMLN tenure. Transparency International's report on this is widely available on the internet.**

I haven't even included those unfulfilled promises of "50 lakh houses" and "1 crore jobs" here.

I have an interest in history and current affairs. Reading history and politics has made me more disillusioned in Khan and his party.

**What frightens me most is that Khan was brought with the help of army and even after seeing the reality,** he still fails to confront the establishment. Our Military has a net worth of **100 billion $** (2008 estimate by Ayesha Siddiqa in her book).

He just criticizes Bajwa only. The fact is that Bajwa himself was just an individual. Just like Asim Munir is today. It's the institution that's problematic, not individuals. Its the institution which instills the mindset in faujis that this country is their personal *jageer.* We can remove a thousand Bajwas and Munirs and replace them but nothing will happen unless the whole idea of establishment is dismantled.

Taking lootas from other parties was wrong, giving tickets to SMQs children was also wrong. He couldn’t go after corrupt people as bajwa wouldn’t allow him, should have resigned there and then

Thank you for brilliant, concise and very much needed analysis which the majority of PTI supporters such as myself laud and appreciate. You have stated the hard truths and simple facts which cannot be disputed or denied. Keep this momentum going, as such posts are needed to wake up ppl with regards to our FUNDAMENTAL problems. 

We cannot even think of progressing until the army is held accountable for its sins and made to pay back the loot it has plundered along with the politicians it props and gives free reign to obliterate a once thriving economy i.e., sub mil kay khathay hain aur bakwas kartay hain kay 'zardari kay pate say phar kar paisay loon ga qaum ka', showbaz...

tbh, this country had such high expectations from IK but he disappointed and I don't blame him 'that much' coz the whole system is corrupt. Every single person on the govt's payroll has an interest in protecting the govt to safeguard their own job and interests at the cost of the common man.

Battle of the shittest

I'll take a few degrees better any day of the week..

Thank god people are realising this now.

Yeah i would argue the same. However in some aspects PTI is worse than Pmln for Punjab. Buzzy was not a good CM. His corruption was the talk of the town his only achievement was lining up his own pockets yet Khan i think want him to be the CM again lol.
PTI did their own violence like on farmers protests, and medical graduates (i think the first time medicos were beaten up in Punjab) . They also tried to further enhance PECA ordinance and i was shocked to see how can a person claim to be for justice and introducing amendments like if the government can pick u up without warrant for criticism. 
And lastly, PTI is mostly just doing propaganda. From Qasim Suri's "zara Islamic touch bhi dey den" to Amreeki sazish, its all manipulation of the masses by inciting fake nationalism to playing dirty politics of religion card. This is more dangerous because majority people lack skills to see through the BS so PTI gets away with all of corruption that they do because in our minds PTI can never be corrupt weather it be Prevaz Ilahi who was the Daku of Punjab to now the president of PTI, to nepotistic stalwarts to local gundas . 

We all know ppp and Pmln are corrupt however we have to agree that PTI is quite corrupt too and we should hold them accountable too.

When the Prophet Muhammad starting preaching Islam, the only people who joined him were old, weak, orphans, slaves, and some of his family members who belived in the message of Islam, the simplicity and the equality of humankind, who enjoined good and spoke out against evil. For the first 15 years, until the Treaty of Hudaibiya, his followers were a very small community of close knit people who believed in the message with all their hearts. However as the message spread, more and more people started to realize that the winds are changing, and old structures will be demolished. They started switching sides one by one. First came the mid tier people, then after the conquest of Makkah the floodgates were open and all old established powerful families 'became' Muslim and joined the cause of Islam in return. However soon the Prophet Muhammad died and these families took over power in a coup. They plotted to sideline the old early converts to Islam as they were more zealous, and adopted a more laissez faire approach to Islam, used it to further their power beyond their wildest dreams. Soon there was a civil strife and war, and eventually the old guard won out by slaughtering the prophet's family and suppressing the ideological voices in Islam. These powerful dynasties went on to rule the domain of Islam for another century and were usurped by another dyansty and so on and so forth for a thousand years.

The point is not to compare IK to Prophet in anyway, IK is stupid dumb and stubborn IK is not even comparable to the dust fleck on the Prophet's shoe. The point is that not even the Prophet could really eliminate old powerful structures, he only rearranged it in the mold of Islam. 

So powerful families and their scions will find one way or another to rule. If you slaughter them, someone else will take their place. The art of politics is not to demolish these structures but to mold them in a way that benefits the most amount of people, and hopefully set in motion a chain of events that will lead to the evolution of a better society.

IK himself might be an okay person. He does have a good vision for the country. As evident by projects like RUDA and CBd etc. I too used to think how we need planned cities or how vacant state land can be used for so much good. But, the issue is his team. It's composed of super corrupt individuals and same feudals he bashes. He bashes zameendaars, but has Shireen Mazari in the team. Pervez Khattak sahib is super corrupt. Everyone in PTI mentions how Bajwa expanded his assets, but no one ever says the same about Pervez Khattak. His wealth growth has been exponential since he came into the government. Lastly, IK took in Pervez Elahi. Need I explain how bad this is?

I wish all Pakistanis would see these politicians as just politicians rather than saviors and khairkhawahs. And treat their fellow citizens better rather than calling them stupid names. This goes for every party's followers.

TLDR is that he didn't fullfil all his promises. Okay what is your alternative? 

Or how about instead of nitpicking things he didn't bring forward, why not acknowledge things that he did do right, however small they may be. Compared to the goons, his track record is 100x better. 

It will take decades before Pak can become a normal country, he's taking the first steps. 

Problem with our people is that they don't want to do anything themselves and criticize those who are doing something

Imagine the situation if leading politician or next PM openly criticised the army. It would lead to people hating on army infront of them, decrease in troop morale and possibly juinior officers quitting.

Ample opportunity for enemy to strike.

Best is to implement structural reforms in army from day on, slowly but steadily cut off its political and financial wings. Make it dependent on government for funds.

Not voting for anyone. But I respect that you call PTI leadership for what it is even though you are a party supporter. This has been my main reason for not voting for PTI. They don't practice what they preach.

Still better than PDM.

If you can't distinguish who wants good for you and who wants bad, i feel bad for you  You are what's wrong with Pakistan. You people just don't deserve IK.

Imran Khan exposes death trap at Judicial Complex; releases video evidence.



There is another video of plain clothed men entering the judicial complex when even IKs lawyers were not allowed in. One of the men in the video was trying to hide his face. Let me find it and i will post that too.

Edit: [Here you can see the man in black clothes hiding his face.](https://twitter.com/Tahir_IK/status/1637487774675750914)

They also came with [plastic handcuffs](https://i.imgur.com/icvUkAh.jpeg) in their hands.

Its the military. We all know it.

There is a New York times video on kashogis' murder. This is typical way on how you implant someone to carry out the deed

At first I was like must be the court personal but after seeing those plastic handcuffs im like really wtf is going on.

Who is the cameraman? If no one was allowed in, how did he make it to the court?

You know IK should definitely consider releasing his videos on 2x speed

And then these cultists start crying when they're called cultists.

Anyone who buys this story about a hit squad at the court, and plans to kill IK despite all the noise…

I have a bridge to sell you - several, in fact.

All this bs to avoid appearing in court.

Please, the foaming PTI idiots, lmk when the last time a political figure in Pakistan was killed by the police, in police custody, in a courthouse with CCTV camera footage 24/7, with every camera trained right on IK. Not to mention the social media presence/reporting. 

IK feels safe in a mob (where like 90% of assassinations in history have occurred) but courthouse is a death trap.

Have the balls to actually criticize the man. Nabi banaya huwa hai, infallible, astaghfirullah. 🤦‍♀️

Only retards believe this clown

What kind of power Imran Khan might be able to muster against the Pakistan army after he comes back to power after winning the elections in October?

Would Imran be able to like take down the Pak army the way Erdogan was able to in Turkey?

You need 2/3 Majority in national assembly.

Not only people in power want his ticket, they also don't want to change the system.

Also Chances of winning a clear majority is low, Imran Khan will have to make coalition with establishment parties like Balochistan Awami Party.

Also Imran Khan is not anti army or anti establishment in general, he just wants certain elements of the establishment gone. 

In the language of real estate, the elites are fighting amongst themselves not for awam

The best he will do is get rana sanaullah arrested, don't expect anything against army from ik once he's in power.

He won't be able to do much. Maybe promote his supporters in the army to upper rank but there's nothing else he can do that will change the position of Pak Army. Why? There's not enough support for him to do this. I hope he take strict measures against the corrupt generals but that's very unlikely.

He'll go back in bed with them

Zero

&gt;the way Erdogan was able to in Turkey

This shows your level of understanding and knowledge. lol

Erdogan purged the supporters and followers of Fethullah Gülen from all departments of the govt including army, police and bureaucracy

I'm tired of 16 yr olds acting like Noam Chomsky on reddit. Bhai please read a few books before spreading your infinate wisdom here.

P.S, i know i'll be severely down-voted now

New location imran khan - get him out tonight!!

Otherwise it’s too late

Umm, how is this verified ?

I would die to save Imran Khan - Close up (Al-Jazeera)



Gives me the "I will sacrifice my whole life for Pakistan" vibes lmao

This film should be spread far and wide.  


Hats off to AlJazeera for showing doing unbiased journalism.

Respect to these people. 

I first found it a little funny how this guys says to her wife “Aap zindagi main baad main aayin hain, pehli khaan sahab the” (You came into my life later, IK was first).

But it just shows how desperate people are for things to change for the better in this country. People, especially from lower classes, really are struggling. :(

So will imran khan be in election if released on bail? I am uneducated on this topic

question

That is if elections happen. From the whole situation, no elections are happening. If by a miracle elections happen, they will be heavily rigged, and a lot of barriers will be erected, which will cause PTI to lose or at least not win the majority. 

Just observing the current situation, they don't want PTI and Imran to win. They will delay the election as much as possible, and with the whole protests and broken law and order, no elections will happen.

If you're talking about the 14th May elections, they ain't happening.

If ... He's already been released. He's literally going to Zaman Park now.

Whether he will in election ... that has nothing to do with the bail aspect.. However, elections have to be happen for him to be in them.

Election commission submitted an application in supreme court to f
Postpone elections and it has made a 3 member bench to decide on it. No elections on the 14th.

End of Imran Khan's Revolution | Unpopular Political History of Pakistan | Syed Muzammil Official



Who da F listens to this clown that he is posted here again and again?

Of course every week Muzummil will just do a new video on IK. Guy is obsessed. 50 banday margaye but boi is like nahi IK py ik or video tu banti.

It's end or not time and election will tell. If they ever conducted one. Also stop listening to him and start listening Moeed Pirzada. He is the only one with any good points.

He is a PDM apologist just like Shehzad Ghias Sheikh. Listen to their podcast they were trying hard not to talk about Imran Khan so the podcast looks like both are critical thinker. Some people hate IK to remain relevant. Syed Muzammil is one of them

i'm struggling to find the point of this video

Syed Muzammil is low-level propagandist who's commentaries are laced with inaccuracies, over-simplifications, gross generalizations, mockery and fallacies. A self-proclaimed intellectual.

His recent childish exchanges with Qaiser Ahmed Raja summed up his true level.

Chutey ki tarya rigna band karo

Even though I dislike this guy. He is right on this one. IK's revolution has failed.

But long term it has definitely brought a change in mindset of Pakistanis so that's something positive

This guy is too good

This clown thinks that the sun has set for Imran's struggle (as per his recent tweet). So much for wishful thinking. I mean, I get it that PTI is going thru a very rough patch atm, but is it over? I highly doubt that. Guys like him completely ignore the 'public' factor.

Abey BC Indians on this sub everywhere. I'm going to eat a bite of steak after every Indian post/comment I see.


End of times. Dr shahid masood.

Have to admit this was extremely difficult and depressing to listen to. Hope situation improves.

Imran Khan Told journalist that he will be arrested today most likely .

Be ready Guys it was a trap

Why can’t the monkeys keep flinging their shit at one another AND let normal life for citizens to continue? This internet shutdown is placing us all back in the stone age.

Imran Khan after-arrest video (made before arrest) in Netero style

Imran Khan knew he was going to get arrested, so he made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffoumvSy97I) before and released it after. Reminds me of Netero from HxH.

Time to get out. Now or never. Let’s see how many of us have the balls.

کشمیر چھوڑو ملک آزاد کراو اس حرام خور فوج سے

because he knew he did the crime &amp; he has to do the time now.

Nahhhhh AINTNOWAY lil bro just used an anime reference. Netero vs Maruem Uhhhhhhh i lostt

What a way to end my final exams.

Just got done with my final school exams and have no way to celebrate it because Imran Khan got arrested today so the whole country is on lockdown. Can't meet up with my friends or do anything really except stay inside and browse the internet. I feel spoilt having these feelings since I know I'm better off than most of the population in the country but as someone still in highschool, I can't help but just have pity. I do pray for those affected though, but I'm pretty much stuck and can't really do anything, just like the majority of the people are. Sigh.

Agree with above comment, don’t beat yourself up for losing out on a normal childhood.

But translate that pity into anger towards the people at the top who are truly responsible for putting you in this situation.

Don't beat yourself up for losing out on a normal childhood experience. Too many of us have had to give up many normal experiences because of the instability of the nation. However, don't become passive. The past few years may have desentisitized us but it's time to take charge. Why must we live in constant turbulence at the whim of power hungry people?

Bhai pura mulk jal raha hai aur tumhe enjoyment ki pari hai

Movies dekho, books parho, rooh afza peeyo chill karo aur shukar adaa karo apni rehmaton ka

Us moment bhai. Matric ke baad Long march mai yakki lagayi inho ne. Upar se 11th ke papers se pehle ye ch\*tyapa. Like can i lead a normal life here? Aik to na kuch available hai locally, na koyi freedom of speech, roti, kapra makaan ka dhandora pichle 50 saal se peet rahe hai. 

Upar se sare ghar wale PDM supporters like i literally cant have shit here bro. I just dont know what to say bhai. It is what it is.

Reason behind release of Imran Khan?



[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/13en0i5)

People give too much credit to the army. They are ruling by danda, not strategy. They can't plan anything too well.

lumber 1 has to save his face why else

I don’t understand how it could be a planned strategy by the establishment. It became clear that he will win the next election once he was overthrown judging by the immense public support. Arresting him in such a manner basically guarantees that he will have a clear majority, might as well just make him PM now and save the election money.

I think it was all pre planned to see awam reaction and it was not what Establishment expected.

Yar say what you will about the supreme court, I am a pti supporter but after looking at the facts you have to admit all of the judgments made by bandial so far have been on a factual legal basis. He's just not taking any shit from anyone. Yes, even the midnight judgement.

IHC and LHC on the other hand are very obviously biased and corrupt.

I mean it’s common sense. The fact he got arrested isn’t the issue it’s the way they arrested him by storming the courthouse and smashing their way through. Don’t think this sets him free, they’re just going to arrest him again unfortunately but in a more ‘suitable’ way.

I have a feeling the decision will be against him tomorrow and thats why hes released

They were desperate to have them all arrested and then suddenly agree to May 15th elections 🙄

if the elections do happen on 15 may, then pti is at an advantage because of all this.. people are on edge and surely will vote

What the hell is going on in Pakistan?

I have no ties to Pakistan or any South Asian country, I am a Bosniak. This post is made purely out of curiosity. 

But I’ve been seeing the news of former PM Imran Khan getting arrested. Why did he get arrested? Who is leading the country? Why is there so much instability and turmoil? What is being done to “fix” the country? How do the Pakistani people tolerate so much turmoil? I have so many questions. 

Pakistan’s politics makes my country’s politics look like child’s play (we have 3 president and ~16 parliaments.)

In nutshell the army top brass aka establishment has complete control over country public n private sector n they see imran khan as threat to their existence so they ve abducted him form court this is y ppl r pissed off. Theres more to it but that should give u picture wts happening

go thru the mega thread that's has been pinned on this sub

things are bad, but i just wana comment that the war in Bosnia was horrific and way worse than anything thats going on right now in PK. Too many lives were lost and the atrocities are not talked about that much.

pakistan  has basically been pushed into turmoil by military juntas backed by the US since its creation

Imran khan was voted out of office in Parliament through Vote of no confidence last year and shahbaz sharif was voted in by the opposition to "lead the country"

Basically, former PM Imran Khan has portrayed himself as some kind of Messiah against the country's corrupt elite for a very long time. Ironically, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has found his involvement in one of the biggest corruption scandals in the history of our country. Imran Khan's fans can't come to terms with the reality that their poster child of anti-corruption can be involved in such a big corruption scandal; they are currently in denial. NAB only wanted to arrest him for investigation, but they considered it some kind of insult against their leader (talk about cult thinking).

Basically, UK's national crime agency recovered some 200 million pounds from a corrupt Pakistani real state tycoon (name: Malik Riaz). The UK gave that money back to Pakistan. Imran Khan, PM at that time, gave all of that money back to Malik Riaz 🤦‍♂️ (that too with the approval of his whole cabinet). Now the question NAB is asking is simple: why did he do that and did Malik Riaz return the favor with bribes? If he can answer the acquisition, he can go free.

NAB asked him to appear for investigation voluntarily, but he didn't respond. They tried to arrest him in a dignified manner, but he asked his supporters to forcefully stop law enforcement agencies from arresting him. As a last resort, law enforcement agencies utilized the element of surprise and arrested him when he was least expecting it. Although the arrest was a bit rough, but nothing other Pakistani politicians haven't already faced a zillion times (and yes, this happened with politicians during his government too).

If you don't know much about Pakistan's politics, just think of this situation as Donald Trump and his MAGA Trumpists. Whenever someone tries to investigate their leaders, they will come up with million different conspiracies instead of answering the actual acquisitions.

Is the current unity in command (entire Army, Navy and AF leadership), MI, MP, ISI unprecedented?

Historically there has never been such a perfect synchronization between departments. Even in the worst periods of oppression the traditional parties PPPMLN usually have some officers on their side (through 'business' partnerships like BTK or Karachi tanker/water mafia or through marriages to high ranking officers) and some lines of communication open.

Also there's always a few channels not towing the establishment line.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now it seems like all the movers and shakers, centers of power have united for one purpose - destroy Imran Khan.

Its not as united as it appears, as I read reports on a lot of purges going on in the officer corps, so PTI does have sympathizers.. Plus Bajwa had a long tenure so he made sure all his promotees were like-minded to him. General attitude in the army as always is to milk the country dry, create fake threats to justify their existence, and make sure the political class is always subservient. They will continue to do so forever and will destroy anyone which comes in the way for DHA.

The high command is against khan, so that appears to be the stance, but junior officers are khan supporters.

Not really, there are people from both sides within the institutions, but there's always a tussle, sometimes one side wins sometimes they lose. Like look at how high court didn't object to IK's arrest bit then SC declared it illegal. But the recent situation in the country called for drastic actions, as the establishment felt a real threat ( even if some of them support pti, they'd still want to keep their sweet perks with them) so bringing the entire system down is in no one's favor, hence you see the current "unity"

Doesn’t matter if they agree or are united or not, they have orders to follow and they do just that. Everyone there is loyal to the institution, like it should be and follow their institution’s leadership. The problem is that the armed forces is the only ones loyal to their institution and that’s why they are so effective. Every other institution and organization in Pakistan has been corrupted and politicized. From the police to tax authorities to the accountability bureau. They’re loyal to only the politicians who put them there. In calmer times when prominent politicians were interviewed and asked how to get the establishment out of politics their response was ‘edaray muzboot karnay hongay’. Sadly though, no politician wants to do that because it’ll also diminish their power.

Solution

Change can only be brought if we pressure the gov many people don't believe this but this will work. But we don't believe this works. And this illusion is created by those who rule us. Pakistani people must realise this not Imran khan nor Nawaz Sharif only you and you alone can bring change. Do not blindly follow or idolise some politician always question them and ask for your rights. All Pakistani elite is bad and have made a system in which only a criminal can climb up to power. And to keep them in check you have to make them worry that not only will you question them but you will also held them responsible and punish them. In Pakistan law is only applied on the week only when it is also applied on the powerful will things change.

&gt; Change can only be brought if we 

IF WE GET INVOLVED. I think WE need to stop thinking about the TOP and start thinking about the BOTTOM.  Get involved in your school. Get involved with picking up trash in your neighborhood. Get involved with solving a problem.  Solve a piece of the problem your family has.  GET INVOLVED!

Turn off DJ-ISPR BS, inform your kids that their future is being robbed to support Bajwaa‘s kids.

Yeh generals ka Pakistan hy.

IK Nawaz and everyone else is just part of the system. They are the distraction while you are being robbed.

People need to network and take care of themselves/one another, only relying on the government when absolutely needed. As this network grows stronger we will be in a position where we can actually pressure the government instead of just beg for scraps.

Pakistan the country that blames the Prime Minister, Judges, Military, and bureaucrats for the ills of the country.

Meanwhile paying a traffic warden 30PKR to get out of a 40PKR speeding ticket while watching a moulana raping a child in the alley.

Just improve your own life. There is no need for people to go an extra mile in support of corrupt politicians.

&gt;All Pakistani elite is bad and have made a system in which only a criminal can climb up to power

This is just an excuse by our people to stay lazy.

Imran Khan’s hypocrisy: Begging US for help

How does everyone feel about Imran Khan being found out as the biggest hypocrite and a liar that he is begging US to intervene and save his guilty ass.
This after he made up a fake story of US conspiring to remove his govt, which he has backtracked from now. Do people feel like this nation need a break from this conman, and his supporters who were being told that Khan is taking all of them for fools, need to apologise for keeping on believing Khan's obvious lies?

He’s apparently not doing a great job otherwise he’d be fighting for Pakistan with a weak heart (almost death vibes) from London with his progeny maligning the country’s institutions from within Pakistan. So incompetent. Guru se rujoo karna chahiye ex-PM Imran Khan ko. 

Mister Platelet is a master of deceit (make written agreements with dictators with the plea to leave country and stay away, but lie to public until exposed and even then won’t render an apology for being a coward). 

Guru’s daughter tells the nation that she doesn’t own any properties even in Pakistan let alone abroad and then gets exposed but doesn’t have the decency to apologize and own up to it. 

Guru’s nephews run off to be in his shade because laws are for the people not Sharifs.

Mister Backache couldn’t come to attend court hearings or NAB investigations because of health but now runs around the world like Arnold ShalwarNikker without any complaints. Bragged about dragging Zardari in the streets of Pakistan but ab dono ghee shakkar hain; Pakistan ke heart valves block kar ke baithay huwe dono bhai.

Remind me again who the liars are?!

Actively calling for the global community- those that stand for Democracy- to take notice and say something about the situation, isn't unprecedented at all. When the international media is so involved in something, it's not unprecedented to ask officials to start talking about it instead of refusing to acknowledge it.

If what you take out of Imran Khan's narrative is that we're supposed to hate America or something, well done.

When you're being robbed of your rights and you ask for the authorities, who claim to be the guardians of the rights, to take notice, is not begging. When the West calls it an internal affair when it clearly is not, it's important to connect with the international community that genuinely cares about it. If you don't agree to it, sorry mate, but cancer is hard to cure, especially when it's in your head.

Op be like standards and rules for IK but not for PDM.

Constitution stands null and void, people being abducted, tortured and murdered,their houses being raided, Economy ass raped               Meanwhile pea-brain OP: ImRaN KhAn LiAr oMg

Beware of too much whiskey, it Could lead to weird postings on social media.

No one’s begging! 

How does it feel that Ishaq Dar keeps begging from the IMF and they keep showing him the finger every time!

Decency denotes holding your own side to the same standards that you wish to try to gotcha others with. It is clear from your submission that you don't support him, and that in fact, you support one of the opposition (doesn't matter which). So, to throw around words like "hypocrisy " and "liar", you must be at peace with your chosen side doing these things as has been historically proven. So even if true, why do you care if IK does it? Or is it that somewhere, deep down, you know you've sold your soul for too low a price?

In politics you shouldn't be against any country. You make decisions if they are a benefit to you which is what you should do with America as well. 

What the corrupt politicians and generals have been doing is taking american order that benefit themselves and the americans while Pakistan is harmed which is against the interests of Pakistan.

And the US has influenced the leadership of many countries some of which they themselves admit to so it probably is true that they had a hand in removing imran Khan and installing people who listen to them. Whether they masterminded is a different question.

It's not hypocrisy. It's politics. What should he do? Say fuck the US? The US needs Pakistan.

Pro-tip. Its best to block these trolls rather than engage with them

Theek keh raha hai shehzady khush reh!

Common man learns about basic foreign policy

OP, haven't your parents taught you not to speak when your mouth is full of biryani?

Unfortunately you’ll be downvoted to oblivion. You still have time to delete this

To the delulu PTI fans... how is it foreign policy to go on every known media organization and wave around papers claiming a foreign gvmt has tried to influence/detract the democratic process in your country? Dredge up analogies with Mossadegh and the Iran coup? Talk about Venezuela? 

And then go to the same accused and ask for help?

Ya'll that's not dIpLoMaCy ... that's desperation. 🫠

Have you ever heard of politician being honest? All the major Pakistani politicians are liars and hypocrites.

Imran Khan’s Arrest &amp; The Burn!ng Pakistan | Masses VS The Military | Syed Muzammil Official



Jahilon ka philosopher, jo sirf selective chezon pe baatain kerta hai

And always has to mention that he thinks hes better than you.

Agayi weekly landey ke philosopher ki appreciation post. He is part of the 'controlled opposition' against establishment nurtured by army itself. He doesn't miss any chance to malign IK or PTI. This phony is unbearable to watch for anyone with any knowledge of history or political science. Only people impressed by this grifter are privileged liberals parroting the all parties same narrative.

Maybe PTI failed because it could not entrench itself with grassroots democratically. Why did PTI not hold Local Government Elections in Punjab? Why did they violate constitution in 2019 by sending elected officials home?

Shireen Mazari, Shah Mehmood and others are leaving PTI. Our nation is suffering the worst form of state oppression, suppression and repression.

Maybe PTI failed because it could not involve public in ground politics?

Maybe depending on electables was not in the interest of us common Pakistanis?

It failed to ensure democratization of even Lahore let alone rest of Punjab

Why did PTI not trust in power of the public and democracy and instead tried to collude with the entrenched establishment?

Why did PTI not hold Local Government Elections and violate constitution in 2019 by sending elected officials home in Punjab? Can you even call yourself a democracy without it? Can you even administer good governance without it (relying on colonial styled bureaucracy instead)

Why did PTI give resignations from National Assembly? This was not at all a wise decision, it only meant to rile useless emotions? Imran Khan could have been a great opposition leader in the house while he could consolidate his party

Why did PTI dissolve provincial assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa? Why let Federal government take over provincial machinery? Everything was lost when this happened, no real power = no future power.

Even I was enchanted by his charisma and rhetoric. Maybe I expected too much, maybe my leader was as bhola as I am, maybe all is not that bad. But the city feels alien now, like those in power are not from us, not representing us.

Maybe politics is not jihad. Maybe politics is consensus, maybe politics is about compromise. Maybe politics is not cricket. Who knows?

I am compelled to feel as if we are entering final stage of 'Establishments front' called PTI, and I feel cheated for the better half of the decade.

bruh, PTI did make a ton of dumb decisions, how about this 

Why weren't the elections held on time?

Why is the CJP not issuing contempt notices to the government? 

Why is the caretaker government still there after 90 days?

All this why because they trapped PTI using a burned house. Bahi pahla sutaya sa tu.

Lmao 🤣🤣🤣 don't eat too much🐴 baryani kids

PTI had 3.5 years, that’s all. They faced multiple challenges. What you’re mentioning takes at least a couple of full government terms to achieve.

you really think things would be any different if pti didn't leave the assemblies? tell me one thing, the ones sitting in the assemblies right now, what are they even doing? are they even elected? isn't it their responsibility to hold elections on time instead of using delaying tactics and lame excuses? what would your 'grassroot democracy' be of any use in a scenario like this where unprecedented force and pressure is being applied to break a party. what about the violation of constitution in the last one year every single day and what about the violation of the rights of millions of voters by not conducting elections?

People from KPK how has a near decade rule of PTI has turned out for you?

Performance of Imran Khan and PatI in KPK?



The first term led by Pervez Khattak was more than we hoped for. We were witnessing standards which we had never expected from a Pakistani Government. Attitude of Police improved for the better. We were made aware of changes in various departments and were kept updated too, health department showing the most signs of improvement. The second term led by Mahmood Khan was not as exciting and groundbreaking as the last term. Some say the governance standards were worse than previous term while others argue this term was mainly continuation of Pervez Khattak’s policies.  


When PTI formed provincial govt in 2013, things were not looking too positive if we look at the number of seats of party. It is in credit to PTI and JI leaders that the term went relatively stable from political perspective. Winning 2/3rd majority in KP solidifies the PTI’s impression on the people. People now trust the party because they were governed up to our expectations for the second term aswell. 


PTI took over the reigns when the province was a mess in itself plagued by aftermaths of US War on Terror. The infrastructure and facilities were either non-existent or better off to not exist. In the first term, we observed visible changes in the capital city. Some districts were prioritised while others were put on a back-burner. What consistently developed were the hospitals and schools, be it renovations or new one’s. Government hospitals in Peshawar today are on-par with Private and more expensive counterparts. The transport system of Peshawar has been revolutionised today by the successful TransPeshawar BRT. 

There are many better things happening in the province and bad things likely, but this is all to my knowledge. PTI is going to win the next term in KP not just for national political stand, but for their governance too.

https://www.techjuice.pk/kpk-records-the-highest-decrease-in-income-inequality-under-the-pti-government/

This question has been asked a lot on this subreddit and on other social media platforms. Search the subreddit history for similar questions. 

It always boils down to PTI supporters will list a slew of positive things and PDM supporters will give anecdotal accounts of things not being so different than b4.

Every thing is better thn previous govts except KPK financial debt.

Where is Buzdar?

PTI and Imran khan are going through very Tough time, almost every leader has been arrested but where is Usman Buzdar aka Wasim Akram Plus? For whom Imran khan got criticized the most and without any Doubt is one the reasons for the Downfall.
I am yet to see even a single Picture of Imran khan with Buzdar since His removal from Cm.

Wasim Akram plus?? 😂😂😭😭

waiting to be CM again!
Buzdar isn't in any Danger He is the Danger, Lol
On a serious Note you are Right He should have been with Ik

Buzdar is/was/will always be insignificant. IK chose Buzdar only because Buzdar as Punjab CM can never be a real threat threat to his authority. Other significant PTI leaders hailing from Punjab could be potential threat to IK if they were to be made Punjab CM. 

Buzdar or Someone like Buzdar will be back as Punjab CM once IK becomes PM. Inshallah.

Buzdar is an electable and a minor one at that. He probably doesn't want things to be tough on himself.

He is smart. Watching from afar but will be back to become CM again if Pervez Elahi doesn't take his place. Also, he always had that puppet vibes when he was CM. No way does a person we didn't even knew exist becomes a CM for province with half of country's population.

&gt;For whom Imran khan got criticized the most and without any Doubt is one the reasons for the Downfall

Really? what did he do? Always seemed like a nice dude.

Buzdar never had any power, or did any real politics. He was simply a placeholder puppet. IK himself directly basically was the CM. That's just how it is. 

We need South Punjab to break up the power structure.

Now what 15 may is around the corner

Ok so imran khan gets into court things go on blah blah blah  
but guys arent we forgetting 15th may is around the corner and there is no sight of elections, we have began debating property damage during protests and all that but we havent disscussed what course of action is the best for protests for elections to be held.   
peaceful protest? do we want another 25th may?  
what can we do? are we to just sit in our homes and let this all happen? are the people really not going to get there constitutional right to vote? are two provinces to stay under caretaker governments?

Either way it's a win win for the people of pakistan.  

From 16th of May "contempt of court" proceedings will begin against the government for not holding the elections

This is what they wanted.

Hopefully, it is what will bring their downfall InshAllah.

Government is on ICU, once ventilator is removed they are gone.

Seeing Popularity of Imran Khan in armed forced on 23 march 2022, bajwa knew he had to remove him. and this was the first time i saw a civilian PM getting this much cheer from armed forces crowd.



Ahhh when the army was our heart, it's amazing how these baigharats don't realize how much damage they have done. But I'm glad in a way this all happened, we all needed to wake up from the sleep and see these zalims for who they are

Bajwa was trying to get rid of him since 2019 lol

In an ironic twist thank Allah for Covid. It literally gave Khan an opportunity to cement his legacy and show that progress is possible in the country.

A year flipped the whole country upside down.

From booming, growing, happy and economical progressive country to unresting, crippling and near defaulting country.

IK was and still is very popular with the armed forces and their families. The problem is Bajwa left his own men behind on key positions like tentacles and for some reason Asim Munir seems either unwilling or too compromised to do anything about it.

What a beautiful day it was…

We were so blinded by our love for the army that we never stopped to think why the army get to have a parade on 23rd March when they had nothing to do with the Pakistan resolution?

They should be far away from 23rd March and 24 August and stick to celebrating the sham 6th September defence day

Torrr check karo...mamoooo!

Naah.. 

A major reason Bajwa was bold enough to conspire against Imran Khan was because he assumed that he (IK) had become unpopular..

It is one of the reasons that PDM abandoned their “vote ko izzat do” narrative and struck a deal too. They thought IK had become unpopular as well. The initial plan had been to change NAB/EVM laws and then immediately head towards elections.

i disagree, I clearly remember Starting 2022 IK was unpopular among Masses
If the Army would have just waited 7-8 Months all of this Blowback could have been avoided
Removal of Imran khan has Showed us How stupid The Generals really are , May Allah Save Pakistan

The picture of Immi jan in the new J10-C still vivid and it lives in my heart

We really miss that time when we called Imran khan as our Prime Minister of Pakistan

Such a weird title. Do you even remember how long it took for VoNC to complete? Just two weeks after 23 March 2022, IK was ousted from the government. No wonder such conspiracies never make sense.

Best of Imran Khan today:

Imran really giving of “im not mad, just disappointed” vibes

immy would have made a good roaster

"Oo ahmaqonnnn" oh man i cant stop laughing. When i saw those pictures i was waiting for his take on this. He went sll out

Lol, I would love to see Bilawal, Maryam and Shehbaz debate IK

Chad Immi

When the teacher accuses backbencher of badmashi:

Bro literally giving the vibes of my parents when I forget to turn off the lights of my room when the family goes out

It is funny how people steal videos and put the watermark on it so no one else can copy their creative work.

😭😭😂😂 not coming easy

Bro was about to say BC😂

PDM shills wishing they're "leaders" could string a proper sentence together

Immy chan on fire

Cabbage

♥️♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘

Police entered his house unlawfully when he was on the way to Islamabad to appear in court. His anger is justifiable... The current cannot justify this gesture.

The Plan

I believe there is a plan in motion regarding Imran Khan's situation. It seems that he won't be arrested at this time, likely to tarnish his image in the eyes of the PTI workers and their families who are currently imprisoned. 

The intention is to portray him as someone who is doing nothing for his supporters. Currently, there doesn't seem to be a risk of further unrest from Khan. 

The strategy is to keep him alive but diminish his heroic status and fame, drawing a parallel to Bahadur Shah Zafar. The evidence and testimony regarding the Jinnah House incident will be presented, and two choices will be given to Khan: deportation or disqualification. 

Releasing him back into the political arena, albeit with difficulties, would be counterproductive and would only result in renewed challenges. Under pressure, the party will be fractured, and loyal gatekeepers will be united under an approved leadership to form a more acceptable party that fulfills all the necessary requirements. 

The examples of this approach can be seen in parties like MQM or Musharraf's Q-League. Efforts are underway to accomplish this goal. As a result, the politically visible figures will continue to perform on the stage, but the real power will be held by those who are shielded from questioning, as if it were a crime to do so.

I mean it could be a googly though. Liie on what basis are they being released? Just sign a piece of paper called the affidavit, that 5 ruppee paper that has no value in this lawless country? And what else, just express your disdain from pti and just "say" in the media that you are leaving pti? I mean it seems kinda shady. Besides, how can somebody change whats in somebodys heart and mind? We all know they are doing it either under pressure or to get rid of jail.

can't take him down so lumber 1 decides to go after other, If only lumber 1 had shown the same passion in solving the countries problems

exile not deportation

He raised over 20 crore in few days for the victim of police? How will NAPAK Fauj hide that?

Imran Riaz Khan Arrested



The real soldier of Pakistan.

Please help identifying the original interview of this audio

I heard this soundbite in a video and wondering when and where did Imran Khan said those words, even the name of interviewer would be helpful if you can recognize him. Thanks!

Why are you getting downvoted just asking a question?

It was from the those “we are on the same page” golden days. 

That same page got torn after Bajwa conspired with US and Israel when he imposed this imported PDM govt. on us.

Imran Riaz Khan was the interviewer

Imran Khan's Children Drawings Smashed by Police in his Home



This man won Pakistan the pinnacle of its sporting glory; built a cancer hospital; founded an international university and was its prime minister. Today, his ancestral house was destroyed; his wife harassed inside his home and the images of his children, who he left to fight for Pakistan, were smashed.

Those pictures were violating rule of law. Some PDM shill.

What the fuck? Fuck the police, fuck the army, fuck the government.

okay now this is personal panga....

I’m not Pakistani by any means but I’ve been following this sub for awhile, this seems a bit extreme and rather cruel.

Police that destroyed these paintings must must've done no creative thing in their childhood or/and don't have any children. Even if they somehow do, I feel bad for those children.

Seriously is there a way to name and shame.

Find out the police and ranger personnel’s who were involved or their seniors atleast. Name them, their location and shame them online. Let the world know about these scum of the earth.

Now this is just low which isn't noteworthy but this time it's downright pathetic and juvenile

You can take all our food, take all our freedom, BUT WE DRAW THE LINE Y’KNOW!

This is beyond belief. These are treasured family memories.

And now, you have officially taken it too far, Buddy

Break's my heart 💔

When I see stuff like this then I have no sympathy for the policemen who get beaten or killed. Some in the media try to paint a picture that the police are forced to follow orders but these kinds of acts just show that they should be blamed equally. 

Only evil people would kill or beat innocents and destroy personal property like this when it's not even part of their job.

Imagine being so petty that you got offended by photos. 

But then again, what can you expect from these people.

Nothing of this sort could happen without Army’s approval.

Police were told by the fauj that awam lacks balls, so they can get away with anything.

A demographic that I always criticize seems to be missing from this post. Not condemning any of these abuses and brutalities. Always proving me right, eh.

Were they ordered to do this specifically? I don’t think so. This is their own deed. And it shows how brutal and heartless our common man is. We need to accept that these jurnails, army walay, shahbaz, nawaz, IG police, junior constable, are all from among us. They are not from outside. How do we fix this animal-like brutality &amp; mindless sadism now?

The f**k man!

idc at this point, i call for ban wave of PDM and establishment shills at this point

حافظ بھڑوا نامنظور

This is what happens when the top is falling over. They'll try everything to stop the change. All corrupted will go inshAllah.

ASSHOLESS

How low will you go? Every institution in Pakistan is running crazy after getting exposed. The naked reality is the worst. We respected these institutions but now there is nothing more than hatred, frustration, and abuse. All this just piling up in our hearts, just like a lava gathers before the volcano erupts.

Knowing how media savvy PTI is, I'm willing to bet 2 plates of haleem it wasn't the police.

Shaukat Khanum medical board advises Imran Khan 'complete rest'

Imran Khan Q&amp;A: ‘Pakistan civil-military imbalance has to change’



I feel like this is brought up every other day in some form so here it is...

&gt;**The current civil and military imbalance has to change if you want Pakistan to get out of this mess.** And by that, I mean a system based on the rule of law. You cannot have a system where the prime minister has the responsibility but he does not have the authority to implement his policies because that authority is shared with the military.

&gt;There is no doubt that there is a role for the military. **You cannot wish away the role of the military in Pakistan because it is entrenched for 70 years.** But you need that balance. 

The military is too powerful to magically disappear. Unless you have some unrealistic wishful view of the world, you have to realize it's going to still be there corrupt as always even if Khan wins again.

It will take time, meaning years, for them to reform and remove bad eggs and change policy. So that means eventual compromises as you slowly move toward the right direction.

Military's power comes from money. Follow the money. Pass laws to bring all factories and lands under civilian government control. If military objects then appeal to people to come out on the street. 

Does any party leader protest when the military removes their opposition party from power? When they start doing so, the system will improve.

absolutely, not that imbalance has to change but turn upside down.

In America and all Democracies, Army serves at the WILL of it's people and the government. They have zero influence outside. That's how it's supposed to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Since 1947, army has looted Pakistan and the brainwashed media uses their propaganda. They have zero respect for the people. They use India as fear to get what they want.

&amp;#x200B;

NEWSFLASH: India has bigger fish to fry and they don't care about competing with Pakistan. FIRST thing if I were in charge, I would remove all ARMY from the border with India, forget about Kashmir and focus on fixing Pakistan. Stop trying to fix Kashmir without fixing yourself first. Who the hell wants to join Pakistan? YES Kashmir is full of Muslims but most of them don't care about joining Pakistan, if they did they would have joined the pak army in wars. They never did, instead they told India the locations of all pak army troopers.

&amp;#x200B;

Make peace with India, advocate for better rights for Muslims in general. And cut the military budget by 90 %. Pakistan forex has less than 4 billion USD, last year 11 billion went to the army, cut that by 90 % and BAMMM deficit problem solved, more currency in economy, use the money to develop instead of relying on handouts.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a reason why even Saudi Arab has given up on Pakistan.

&amp;#x200B;

China will protect pakistan, India has no rhyme/reason to invade Pakistan. Let go of Kashmir. Let go of all these fraud Army people. Imran Khan needs to do this.

He is very much like Trump as in his ideas are hated but they are the truth.

It did change after Charter of Democracy. Civil military relationship remained stable during Zardari and early Nawaz eras aside from few minor hiccups like Memogate or Dawn Leaks. Then Moron Khan decided to orchestrate a sit-in in Islamabad at the behest of General Shuja Pasha to topple Nawaz Sharif Government. After the Dharna came Panama scandals and Imran -Army nexus used it to remove Nawaz from PM house. In 2018 election, PMLN electables from South Punjab were "persuaded" by ISI to switch their party from PMLN to PTI. 
  
After the elections army and Imran used their combined strength to throw every political opponent to jail. They suppressed media and Imran praised Bajwa for being a democratic COAS. 
  
The reason army is powerful today is because of Imran. PMLN and PPP were chipping away at the power of army but it was Khan who sabotaged their every effort to reign in Army. Of course now he wants army to stay away from politics because he is confident that he can win elections without their help but it does not work like that. Unless he sits with Zardari and Nawaz for Charter of democracy 2.0, army will keep its power.

Why is Imran Khan so popular?

Hello everyone, apologies in advance if these types of questions aren’t allowed, but I am genuinely curious. 

All over Tik Tok I see so many Pakistans both diaspora and those still in the country extremely sad and angry about the situation going on with Imran Khan. Knowing Tik Tok, I’m not sure if they are just brainless 14 year old children or educated citizens. Looking over his biography he definitely is not the most religious politician. And his ideologies are very harsh. He supports both the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban and has negative viewpoints on Shias, which I guess would be popular with some Pakistanis. In my eyes he seems like another nasty populist.

But I’m NOT Pakistani so I want to know the viewpoints from real Pakistanis. My stance doesn’t matter, I don’t have to live with the political consequences. 

As a Pakistani, why would you say he is so popular?

Im a Shia, and he’s not against Shias. He doesn’t speak out against Shiism. 

He’s popular because he’s the only guy who wants to bring rule of law to Pakistan. 

Also, he’s always worked for the betterment of Pakistan (3 cancer hospitals, NAMAL university etc) prior to his time in politics. He’s not in politics for personal gain (unlike his opponents, PDM, who’ve literally used public money to start their own businesses). 

During his time as a prime minister, Pakistan saw its best economic days (read all the gdp stats, first time in history we started paying down our debt etc) while his government set up a world class social welfare system (ehsaas) to uplift poor people. 

Lastly, he’s no coward who runs away in times of despair. He’s a true leader who leads from the front and not from behind (or London).

He is not supportive for Talibans. All he says is that bring them to table to negotiate. For example if world doesn't give a shit about Afghanistan's current regime and dont even want to talk to them then how can world criticize them for everything? IK says let them involve in UN and other economic forums and then use those forums to influence them for reforms.

When every one else is coal even a Rock with blemishes is a dramatic improvement. 

Khan is one of the few guys whose put time and made his way up from local to national over 20-30 years. Sharifs and zardaris have played catch with the PM and president seats since near the founding of Pakistan not to mention the army just choosing when they feel like to takeover. Also sharifs and zardaris are known corrupt and taking money from state coffers. They've sold the country piece by piece over the years so now Pakistan's largest budget item is servicing its debt. 

People know he has flaws but what they also know is putting the same two idiot families in charge is how they got here in the first place. There is no government if people don't believe in their ability. Not to mention the sharifs and zardaris should've been already disqualified but that doesn't matter cause we have something that's even above constitution and whatever that thing says goes.

\&gt; He supports both the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban and has negative viewpoints on Shias

\[Citation Needed\]

Clearly you haven’t lived in this country, you need experience of living here to know that he is the best option for this country.

Pakistan, unfortunately unlike India, never had a cohesive vision to which all it's stakeholders agreed to. It started right after the independence with cold war in it's infancy. Pakistan was forced to choose sides (due to its proximity to Iran and Central Asia) between USA or USSR. All national unifying figures such as Quaid, Liaquat, Fatima, Mujeeb, Zulfiqar, Benazir, Nawaz and now Imran have either been in power or never allowed to be in power. Whoever was in power implemented reforms but was never 'allegedly' allowed to finish their tenure. All half baked plans never accomplish their true aims. This is evident now by the state of our institutions and economy. 

External forces have always played a major role in these periods of civil unrests. This is not to downplay the destabilizing factor and the enabling role of the military and the feudal families (commonly known as the establishment).

Pakistan, like India, should have implemented land reforms straight after independence. This should have been done to bring us out of the medieval/colonial era to the modern times.

Imran is popular because he is the only one out of the current crop of politicians who doesn't come from feudal families or dynastic politics. His narrative sells to the common man. Even though his political party is full of opportunistic leeches, I do believe that he has Pakistan's best interests at heart. I would like to see him back in power because the amount of fascism going on in Pakistan has seldom been seen or experienced in our short but tumultuous history.

Lol. You are either Indian or Afghan I can guess from your post.

Shias are his huge supporter. Multiple ulemas openly side with him too. He doesn't support the Taliban or TTP but yes he is Pro Afghan. Keeping in mind he was also very welcoming towards Arshaf Ghani and even went to Afghanistan to meet him. does it make him pro Asharaf Ghani who was also using NSA against Pakistan.

He does have a perception built over the years and used as political point scoring as if he is Pro taliban. He was against drones a few years ago so he was called as Taliban Khan back then.

Working with the Taliban is our foreign policy which has nothing to do with the Party. Foreign policy is the Establishment's domain (unfortunately).

PDM for example did the same. Rana sana ulla continuously did pressers about how they are talking with TTP as the Afghan Taliban requested. Even recently they had the same dialogue.

Bilawal for example asked for a standing army for the Taliban and asked the west to engage with the Taliban as isolation will not work. One can call Bilawal Taliban Bhutto as well. But perception is not created yet.

He reached beyond ethnic and religious lines even though he derives his morality from religion itself. Basically uses religion to promote unity in Pakistan not further divide. Something no one did since the Founding fathers themselves. NO ONE in Pakistan wants to go to war with the Taliban. Most people are sane enough to know after decades of fighting them that the more we kill the more we create. He was the only one against the military ops from the beginning. He has never said anything about Shias. Not that I know of. There was one video where a shia and sunni clerics were protesting together for him. 

Only man to reach across Pakistan. People say the military built him up. That is a false narrative. He used to always say my supporters are these youth one day they will grow up. Now the biggest portion of his supporters are under 35, educated middle class. Something that grew organically over the years. They used to call the PTI 'mummy daddy' party only a few years . Now the state wants to brand them terrorist. Btw PTI's clout comes from IK. Very few leaders in there that are in it for the cause and most are there for the Money and Fame. Now that the PTI is under pressure the rats are jumping ship.

This is what happens when you've been trained and built up by not 1 but 5 military generals starting from general hamid gul and even now he is part of their internal power struggle. Plus he is charismatic as F.

Stans will give you all sorts of ridiculous reasoning about how he's the messiah the world needs but for the majority, he's the "lesser of the two evils" kind of thing. He may be bad/incompetent etc but the other side are fkn clowns. It also doesn't hurt that he's a national hero for his contributions to sports and philanthropic sectors of the country. He has an inbuilt fandom from that and given Pakistan's affinity for cult-of-personalities, that fandom translated perfectly to his political career once he became mainstream with the help of the military propaganda machinary.

Remember, no one gave a damn about him when for the first twenty odd years he did speak highly critically about the military. Everyone was sucking the military dicklet back then. Once he decided to get in bed with the military, they gave him the mainstream media platform, gave him the support of "electables" and he was finally able to redeem his heroic image. And yes, he's smart and realized quite quickly what works to invoke the sentiments of the country's emotional populace.

How do we know they are torturing the leaders leaving PTI?

Why aren’t there any claims made to the UN or some human rights organizations?

You have Shireen Mazari getting arrested 5 separate times. You have video proof of women being slapped and dragged by their hair by the police. You have people whose hands and arms have been broken. You have 25 people shot and killed point blank for peacefully protesting. You have journalists like Imran Riaz Khan arrested but unable to be presented to court despite multiple court requests. And yet you are here creating disingenuous threads like this. Please go away.

Exodus is not natural, it can't be all organic.

Its funny when people have change of hearts right after they had been in prison. Just put 2 and 2 together

The fact that every single person says the same thing “I am under no pressure” “what happened on may 9 was wrong and army is the best bla bla” same script ffs

UN and Human rights orgs are just tool to twist arms when there are agendas in west's own favor. Otherwise these western orgs do not serve any real noble purpose.

If they are torturing common protestors, they are definitely torturing PTI leaders

These are the same people who jump around from party to party for over 20 years then only joined PTI in 2018

https://fb.watch/kLqI-VXzh5/

Try spending a day without AC or a fan in 43C heat in a closed small room. You can also try spending 4-5 hours in a toilet to get the feel of torture they might be facing. And before anyone says the same thing happened to PPP and PMLN leaders when they were in jail. No it didn't happen to them like this, Sharjeel Memon had Alcohol bottle with him when he was jailed but reported as honey and olive oil. Nawaz Sharif who should have been in jail is spending his time in London.

Because imran khan told me so

Through the lens of History.

Every event that takes place must not be viewed with a lens that blurs out the past. The recent arrest of Imran khan is such an event that we as a nation must view with lens that lets us take a look at the belligerents with clear vision. Three major parties are involved in this debacle. First is the Govt (PDM) second is Opposition (PTI) and the third one and the one that matters most is Establishment (Armed Forces). Historically the establishment has ruled this country for their own benefits and not for the good of the Pakistani people and this is corroborated by events in the past such as

1. three major marshal laws,
2. three wars started by the said establishment and
3. introduction of new political rivals to counter those who stood against them. 

PTI is an introduction to the third point aforementioned. PTI was formed to negate the popularity of PML-N, PML-N was formed to negate the popularity of PPP in Punjab and PPP was formed when the father of our establishment took Bhutto into his fold. Other political identities such as MQM were also formed by the same establishment to negate the popularity of PPP in Karachi, Sindh. All of these political identities that were introduced have one thing in common. They all failed to be the puppet of establishment indefinitely. This constant failure of the same strategy so far has yet to be identified by the establishment which is adamant that this will eventually work hence the introduction of IJI 2.0 in the form of PDM. So let us be skeptical when ISPR tells us that 9th May is black day. Let me remind you that there have been many black days in our short history that were directly caused by the very establishment.

* 7th October 1958 (First Marshal Law declared)
* 23rd September 1965 (Ceasefire accepted)
* 16th December 1971 (Fall of Dhaka)
* 4 July 1977 (Second Marshal Law)
* 26th July 1999 (Defeat at Kargil)
* 12th October 1999 (Third Marshal Law)
* 16th December 2014 (APS School Massacre) 

It is evident through the lens of undistorted history that these “Black days” have yet to be answered for if they ever could be answered. Just the shame of what we did in East Pakistan is enough to put our head down in shame. In addition to this what establishment is doing in Balochistan, Gawadar’s fishermen and with the Pashtoon community is enough for me have no sympathy for establishment. The destruction of public property is sad and regrettable but it is the only outcome expected form a public that has been spoon fed fanaticism and propaganda. To conclude I want to take one lesson form our own history. Whenever you try to reign in a wild spirit such as Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, Altaf Hussain, Akbar Bugti, Manzoor Pashteen, Benazir Bhutto, Murtaza Bhutto or Imran Khan there will be a violent backlash. Don’t forget that armed political struggle has happened in the past when Murtaza Bhutto created a militant organization called Al-Zulfiqar, MQM’s history is well known and Akbar Bugti died fighting against this establishment and these are just a few examples of Supposed villains of their time who turned out to be heroes of liberty. 

Mamoon Azam

Small nitpick:

&gt; marshal law

Martial law

Hence always rely and fallback on shareefs the trusted partners that thru years have proved no resistance, walk over, most corrupt, easily controlled party and nurtured by one of the best lumber1 guy.

Imran khan's body language is getting weaker day by day.

Look at his last 2 press conferences. He is weaker than ever since 25 April 2022. I guess he is losing hope now.

I can’t give him enough credit for still trying to keep some credibility for the institutions for the sake of the country, even though they are literally trying to kill him. It takes a strong man to not go as low as his adversaries are.

the man is literally battling alone with 13 parties, ALL state institutions, and still standing. or phatti opponents ki pari hy, i would say he's doing pretty good.

He still looks good for 70. But he must be under rremendous stress now, it really wears on you after a time. May Allah make it easy for him and give him a long and healthy life.

I hope Pakistanis will change after him. I hope nawaz sharif’s words “after one month everyone will be quiet after he’s gone” will be proven wrong

Man this is depressing. People really need to make an example out of one of them. There is no constitution according to the pdm. So eff the system. Time to drag them on the streets

It is not solely his responsibility to struggle for this country. If people keep sitting on their butts, we'll lose him soon and then it will take decades before we get a leader like him.

He's probably wondering when Pakistanis will become more like the French. It's fun shitting on France but the French people have more ghairat in one pinky than we have in our entire body.

All the odds are stacked against him but he’s still in the trenches— fighting.

You would be stressed too if orders of your assassination were signed

People really need to get out and get to the GHQ

Brother he is 70, 70 ! The strength he has and what he has been doing since last year is just a miracle tbh, Probably the Prayers of Awam

Sometimes I honestly wonder, why is almighty testing him so much?? I mean the guy is 70. Will he ever get to see the Pakistan of his dreams?? Will he ever get to see the corrupt politicians and bajwa and company getting PROPERLY punished?? 

I mean nawaz sharif is sentenced to 10 years while maryam is sentenced to 6 years, YET they're roaming free and will also contest elections again, this is the true face of our judiciary. 

Had it been anyone else, kab ka mayoos ho chuka hota.

He is more worried about his ppl. 10 year olds are getting abducted, women workers are harassed. The person closest to him day in day out, Mashwani is abducted by the junta and his whereabouts are still unknown.

I wouldn't be surprised if they were poisoning his water at this point.

Man, poor guy. I feel so bad for him.

Its so hurtful seeing him like that

Have you seen nawaz tho with his chin mask?

Kind of reminds me of Ukraine's leader appearance Before/After Russian invasion.

He's a human after all.

He should focus on his life now. We Pakistani do not deserve him. All we deserve is that billo and mariyam glass now.

this post made me sad.

Poor uncle was dumb to have hope in Pakistanis. He's not gonna get the revolution he hopes for. Not in his lifetime at least. 

Visa lagwao aur bhago

Word is that he has been taking 2 antidepressants lately. 💊

Doctors put him on medication to help manage stress, which he is sure to have loads off after the siege on Zaman Park. And then the abductions and forced arrests are yet another layer for him to deal with.

The man was shot and remains under constant threat of harm, while his political allies are being arrested, threatened, and subjected to extrajudicial punishment. He is also a father with kids, he gets assassinated he leaves behind his entire family.

He probably getting older and weaker due to stress and fear for his life. He has isolated himself into a home. I think establishment want his party but without him. SMQ would be fine prime minister and IK know his vote bank will be used but he would be not given chance to be PM again. Even if he is PM I doubt his gov or his candidacy going to last long.

Dont think so ... he is a fighter .. may lord be with him always , ameen

Only a revolution would throw this “Namaloom Afraad” cancer that has been eating Pakistan for decades, sacrifices has to be made for they are the real culprits.

This isn't from today

Ya Allah, I really pray to you that these people are thrown in hell for eternity.

Ghadar fauj.

Revolution incoming Inshaa'Allah. Guys if anyone finds bajwa in any of the streets in Dubai, please beat him up.

Corrupt Fauj want to use retaliation as an excuse to escalate, don’t fall for it. Fauj can not kidnap everyone and everyone knows it.

Becoming North Korea day by day. The situation looks bleak af. At this point, I think they'll indefinitely hold off elections and Pakistan will become a civil dictatorship (with army's ashirwad).

I don't know why PTI seems to think that Pakistan can change without a revolution. Either this country will break or strengthen. Pick up weapons, make a strong union don't let anyone point any finger at you let alone do these heinous acts.

Biggest snake is Pakistan army and when the very snake you put there to defend yourself turns back and bites you, it is time to cut the the snake's head off.

Second biggest is the Judiciary. They should meet the same fate as the army.

where are the PDM and Army sympathizers now? Loving their mothers perhaps...

waisay bohot bhonktay thae, ab zubaan army k paon ke neechay lagi huwi hai

Fuck PDM and Army

This feels like Iraq under saddam

Guess it’s time to enforce self defense through any means.

Should dump all of these traitors in power into an acid bath, the army and the elites, the whole lot of them.

Goddamnit man the kind of shit we pakistanis are dealing with and everybodys all like oh look at fwance, bhai woh france hai, insaniat wahan abhi bhi zinda hai. Bloody weatern media. Compared to pakistan france is a cake walk otherwise those french pussies could not manage to protest 1 sec in pak. So stop comparing and saying imagine if we all did xyz.

these PIGS are worst than the Israeli Jews the way they are acting, honestly public beheadings would be a good way to execute them once Power is returned to the people In'Sha'Allah and infront of their families including their children is a must.

At this point, Pak Army has taken over the country officially. They had been preaching, India is the enemy while all along they were the real enemy of awam.

Ya Allah! 💔

This was so painful to read.

Can Imran khan still be arrested

Can he be arrested on Monday?

if his bail is cancelled then yes

He's got close to 150 cases registered against him. At this point they will say he is the reason Ozone layer is getting bigger and arrest him for that.

Anything is possible. They can file a new FIR and arrest him in that case.

Bail in all cases will remain in effect till 15th May, monday

Mushkil hai. Agar inho nay ghar jana hai. Tou kar bhe saktay hain. Laikin na mumkin hai pichlayyyy subbb tamaashayyy k baad

For Overseas Pakistanis who want to help

If you are in the UK, please write to your local MP about the atrocities being committed by the 'Nazi' regime that is oppressing the people of Pakistan, and persecuting anyone who disagrees with them. 

I have written the letter below. Please feel free to use this or write your own. A copy of this has already been sent to a number of MPs across the UK and handed in to at least one devolved parliament in person (not sure how effective it would even be, but we can try).

  
Find your local MP's contact details here: [https://members.parliament.uk/FindYourMP](https://members.parliament.uk/FindYourMP)

You can write and print out a letter (or the letter below) and send it via post, or at the very least, send it via email.

The idea is to put pressure on the UK parliament to at least recognise the atrocities being committed. Whether they care or not is not up to us, but the least we can do is raise our voices.

Non-UK Overseas Pakistanis: Please do something similar and write to your local government representative. Unlike in Pakistan, western governments are actually answerable to the people they represent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dear \[Your MP's Name\],

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you as a deeply concerned citizen regarding the recent arrest and ongoing unjust treatment of Mr. Imran Khan, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan. His unwavering commitment to democracy, his tireless fight for the rights of the Pakistani people, and his steadfast adherence to the rule of law have been met with intimidation, harassment, and now, unlawful arrest.

&amp;#x200B;

Since his removal from office in April 2022, Mr. Khan has been the target of over 150 baseless cases and allegations, borne out of a desperate attempt to discredit and silence his voice. His family, party members, and supporters have been systematically harassed, and his home raided. It is with a heavy heart that I also note the attempts on his life and the abduction and/or murder of innocent civilians who support him.

&amp;#x200B;

These troubling circumstances bear an uncanny resemblance to the early stages of oppressive regimes like the Nazi era. History has shown us that the silencing of voices, the intimidation of the press, and the use of state machinery for personal vendetta are harbingers of a deep societal crisis.

&amp;#x200B;

The silencing of Mr. Khan and the media crackdown in Pakistan is a chilling echo of the persecution faced by great leaders like Nelson Mandela. Like Mandela, Mr. Khan has been the voice of his people, standing for their rights, and seeking to uphold the Constitution of Pakistan. It is disheartening to see that, like Mandela, Mr. Khan is now being subjected to the same harsh treatment, not for any crime committed, but for standing up against an illegitimate government and the deep state within Pakistan.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to the persecution of those who dare speak the truth and the murder of the prominent journalist, the late Arshad Sharif; the shutting down of internet services, attempts to censor social media and the blackout of mainstream media in Pakistan, are all glaring attempts to control the narrative and prevent the world from witnessing the atrocities taking place. This is not the mark of a democratic nation. It is a sign of a regime that fears the truth and transparency.

&amp;#x200B;

I urge you to use your position of influence to call upon the international community to take notice of the deteriorating situation in Pakistan. It is vital that we extend our support to the people of Pakistan in their fight for democracy and rule of law. We must advocate for a fair and transparent investigation into the allegations against Mr. Khan, and condemn the use of state resources to suppress dissent.

&amp;#x200B;

We cannot stand by as a beacon of democracy and watch another descend into autocracy. I implore you to raise this issue in Parliament, calling for the UK government to take a strong stance on this matter.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your prompt response.

&amp;#x200B;

Yours sincerely,

\[Your Name\]

Been in contact with a local rep. They are watching the situation v carefully but don’t expect any intervention or opinion anytime soon.

According to Pakistanis on the sub we have no right . We have no say or opinion on things which happen in Pakistan

Ur services are celebrated

I would

Will PDM try to arrest Imran Khan again?

What do you guys think?

Yea of course. They won’t stop until he’s behind bars then they’ll have a fake election with no opposition then scream “bUt wE HaD ElECtiOns”. He will be arrested again on May 15th.

Don't think so. Their mail goals seemed to be:

1) Delay elections, as dated by Supreme Court at 14th May.

2) Declaring the party as terrorist organization, as Rana Sanaullah is openly threatening about it, and they might as well do it given the current situation.

3) Have civil unrest, and let the general public and all institutions battle it out, while pulling the strings from shadows.

Pretty sure it's only going to get worse from here, but I don't think they'll touch IK agian.

He’s out on bail no?

SHO pursuing Imran Khan’s assassination attempt case dies [heart attack]



He was a plaintiff in Imran Khan assassination attempt case.

They are using some sort of nerve agent on these people. Maqsood Chaprasi, Dr. Rizwan, and now SHO Aamir - all conveniently dying from sudden heart attacks.

like maqsood chaprasi. how convenient.

Unexpected but expected

NAB guy pursuing case against Shahbaz died coincidentally too

Boys playing well... With needles!

Nothing wrong of course young men dying of heart attacks.

Shameless tactics

One of these Harry's has gotten his hands on some nerve agent and is going around killing people.

Everything fishy

I'm sure its due to natural causes. /says PDM

This curse will suck this country bone dry until it's no more!

The suffering of Imran Khan

Whatever is happening to Imran Khan is so sickening .Poor man is being punished for his kindness, he dedicated his entire life to Pakistan, leaving behind his wife and children. He has been treated badly throughout his life. Even at this old age, he is still fighting for Pakistan, facing bullets. All the corrupt politicians who were insulting each other badly until yesterday have now come together against him. It's heartbreaking that even though almost the entire nation is with him, the Firouns of time are not letting him live. This is what happens to those who raise their voices for the truth and justice in this country. Those who are still with the PDM have no religion or faith or are blind. Those who are against Imran Khan are themselves corrupt. If something happens to Imran Khan, there will be no hope left for this country. Kia baney ga is mulk ka and fuck Bajwa , intehai fazul insan hae . I don't understand, it seems like all these thieves will get caught but nothing happens . Why can't all these PDM ke siyasatdan and corrupt army chief die and let Imran Khan live in peace .

imagine a country where 14 political parties, the police, army, COAS, judiciary and every single corrupt mafia has joined hands to oust one man. Doob ke marr jao behgairto :)

That's the price you pay for speaking truth in this rotten country.

There is a very good chance that they'll (God forbid) k!ll him before upcoming elections. NaPak Army can't afford an independent leader at the helm.

They need someone like Showbaz who keeps gagging on their balls and boots.

The sad thing of all this is that of you watch speeches of IK when he just started politics you'll see that he has been saying the exact same thing he says nowadays. He tried to warn us for more than 20 years. It might be too late now.

The biggest mistake IK did was joining the part of this corrupt system that is established by the military to come into power.

Not that I blame him since there is no other way to come to power lol.

ELI5: What caused (from an outsider perspective) the abrupt downfall of IK?

I dont understand after what the population has gone through in the past year in regards to inflation and their daily lives becoming soo hard, knowing the corrupt have come together for themselves only. Why don't we come out of our homes, take off our chooriya and take back our country. The army is not gona shoot at us its just gona be the police and a few generals or 100 or so ppl from top of military. We keep saying arshad sharif was our red line that wss crossed and nothing happened, now we say IK is our red line but it won't be. An innocent person was killed by the establishment in front of us, he was an innocent soul, they barbarically killed him intentionally to send a message and yet we didn't come out. I'm not talking about our poor awaam I'm talking about everyone from all who want change. To get change u need to snatch it. Its time for inqilab yet we wearing chooriya.

Actually Imran has appealed to the youth of Pakistan to rise, to fight for their rights but seems the youth are so docile nothing moves them, not injustice, not corruption, not inflation....nothing. This country is not worth Imran...

I pity him and salute his bravery. However, every politician in the history of Pakistan only endures pain to serve the rich not the poor

Half the people in this sub are against IK. And these are supposed to be country's educated, upper class

You need to realise this: His opponents are criminals who would suffer huge consequences if IK ever came to power with a proper majority and made proper reforms in the country.

So no matter what they have to stop him regardless of cost. They are also very rich and powerful people so they can employ a lot of resources. Of course they will never say IK is good, they have to malign him as much as possible and spread fake propaganda.

They don’t care if someone gets killed. They don’t care if the economy tanks. They don’t care if the country goes down. They don’t care about how many laws are broken or if the constitution is violated. They simply cannot let IK come to power again. 

As for our people that get tricked by these corrupt people, we’ll they deserve them if they believe their lies.

Umpire ki ungli ab uthne lagi he\*

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't Imran Khan a Taliban supporter? The good thing about him was, that he wasn't related to the other political dynasty families in Pakistan and that he was a political newcomer, meaning that didn't have as many opportunities to become corrupt as the other politicians.

Pakistan should ban relatives of other politicians to become politicians themselves and only let one person per family become a politician. 

The longer you keep power inside a family, the more corrupt they become.

Maybe Pakistan should also introduce universal conscription like Turkey or Switzerland to flush out any existing corrupt military officers with fresh uncorrupted souls from new families.

when will millions march to overwhelm these mofos.

\&gt;  he dedicated his entire life to Pakistan, leaving behind his wife and children
  

  
🤣 LOL Why do you think he left his wife and kids for Pakistan?  Serving Pakistan does not require a man to leave his wife and kids ?
  

  
You are just in a PERSONALITY CULT. 
  

  
Imran khan is no saint he is just another politician . you can argue that he is better than the rest but still he is just a politician. Other political parties have also faced violence. 
  

  
Imran khans throne was taken from him by

1. The  Lotas who he himself allowed in his party
2. The Establishment which he himself supported 
3. The corrupt judicial system  which he never bothered to introduce reforms for even after naming his party tehreek e **INSAF**

This cult just can't stop worshipping their Imran Bhagwan

his entire party is no different then the PDM. they are even married to each other lol  

a vote for the PTI is a vote for the PDM and a vote for the PDM is a vote for the PTI. you are getting the same economic and social policies

Imran Khan granted interim bail in all cases.

Update: The Islamabad High Court has ordered that Imran Khan cannot be arrested in any case (new or old) until May 15th: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/13fjjhm/the\_islamabad\_high\_court\_has\_ordered\_that\_imran/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/13fjjhm/the_islamabad_high_court_has_ordered_that_imran/)

Imran Khan can’t be arrested in any case registered after May 9, till 17th May - Court orders

So someone asked about accomplishments of IK . He claimed his supporters liked hum cause if his personality or something. I copied that reply and pasted it here. Feel free to correct me, mock me, disagree or support me.

My pov as a 17 year old in Pakistan who is here since last 5-6 years. 
Firstly, I would like to start by saying I don't know much about politics nor am an economist. So I will be able to talk about stuff as far as my eye can see.

Now for Imran Khan or pti, I hated the fact that dollar was rising. I hated that everything was getting more expensive. You know all this stuff. That's mostly what I hated like that's it.

What I loved: I live in Abbottabad which is in KPK so first benefit was sehat Sahulat. It has been of immense help especially since my mom has cancer.


Secondly I liked the changes made to the educational system. Some might say this isnt a big deal but believe me it is. The content is so old you can't believe it. Literally, the syllabus my mom had done was still being taught in the same rattu manner.

The initiation of construction of the dams.


This one isn't too noticeable or isn't noticeable by most people but since pti came, load shedding decreased as far as I could see. I remember sometimes it felt like it hadn't gone for a week not even kidding right now.


Steps taken to promote agricultural growth. The numbers spoke for themselves.

Promotion of local production, etc, now it just might have been a lucky timing, but the number of brands that opened/started manufacturing in Pakistan was good. Many Chinese car manufacturers came. Mg too, started being imported, and as far as I know, it is also produced locally. Samsung started assembling in Pakistan. Now all of this isn't too beneficial (for the common person) but in the long run it is definitely something to be reckoned.

As I said, I don't know about the economy, but as far as I know, it was going in a positive direction? Feel free to correct me or provide more info.

Edit: Forgot to mention that I used to cry about the USD ratio pkr situation alot until I got to learn about the artificial rate thing which still makes me go mad to this day.

Edit 2: Forgot to mention how well we handled covid, we were even made an example for other countries by WHO.

Also tourism got a great boost. Its not something I am saying because I heard it. I've seen it on YouTube alot. Many YouTubers came here after ptis governance. Again could be lucky timing for pti but we can't know for sure.

Ooh ooh, another one. More just keep on coming lol. No more drone attacks when he came. This one definitely isn't coincidental.

Another one lol, he took steps for evm and also wanted to let overseas Pakis practice the right to vote. But ofcourse fair elections hazam nhi hone and overseas are majority with pti so it couldn't happen.

Another one, he spoke about Muslims and Islamophobia in UN. His body language tells he is proud to be PM of Pakistan. He doesn't look like he is in fear that he will say something wrong. He knows what he stands by

[https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/ttg6cy/positive\_things\_that\_imran\_khans\_government\_did/i2xnxik/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/ttg6cy/positive_things_that_imran_khans_government_did/i2xnxik/?context=3)

I have this brilliant comment saved that i simply copy paste whenever some PDM shill brings forward lies about IK's InComPeTenCe. 

Truth is that IK was a shockingly effective and competent governor for the standards set in Pakistan. Some people hold this view that IK is "the best of the worst" but in reality he was just straight up a very good governor in extremely tough circumstances for the country (including Covid during his tenure), no matter who you compare him to.

My take on this, also from Abbottabad, PTI coming into power resulted in immense change, KPK police got better, the whole structure was changed, look at the KPK police now, not a single video of police violence unlike the Punjab police.  Sehat card was a massive relief, this allowed poor people to get free treatment, millions got treated and operated, something that wouldn't be possible, panah gah was a massive relief to the poor people

the education system got better, my village had no teacher, now the teachers are present every day, the government officials came and gave a telephone number to call if teachers weren't showing up, no more ghost employees any longer. PTI invested heavily in tourism sector, international tourists were at an all time high, overseas were going to northern pakistan rather than Italy or alps. 

The economy was a million times better, people were crying over prices increasing by 5 rupees per year, now its like 50 per day

Very well put 👌🏼

You’re right on the money 👏🏽

According to Major Adil Raja (R) @SoldierSpeaks, Imran Khan is being held in NAB Office G-6 opposite Lal Masjid, Islamabad.

Imran Khan exposes the latest assassination plan against him; gives clear instruction to PTI supporters outside Zaman Park to not engage in any violence.



PDM Bros are gonna be on suddenly now and comment why PDM/Army would not do this despite a history of killing innocents and Journalists and Peaceful Protesters , Political Rivals , Unofficial political deals with terrorist groups , Sabotaging Investigations into their crimes.

But how arresting 10yr olds and abusing their mothers is legal and morally right without any warrant or even dare to comment on those posts like a true cult

Only IK the guy who predicted his assassination and aftermath exactly word to word is wrong.

I feel like giving up in so many parts of my life.  But this guy reminds me to keep going on.  Some people do not get to the promised land but they let the rest of us know to not stop.

Pakistan doesn't deserve a great leader such as him.

He should name one leader who should be leading the cause if he gets in jail or dies. Otherwise his party will be broken into pieces.

Did thing by preempting this.

And also well done by the no violence message

Lol. Cant believe so many people simping for this guy. I mean I used to support this guy 100% when he came into power. But hes had his turn, and is Pakistan really any better for it? 

I still support him, just to see if he will actually rein in the establishment when he comes into power. But prople online worship his words like he is comin up with the next holy book.

Great plausible deniability if/when a PTI worker throws another petrol bomb at the cops. IK will just say it couldn’t be one of his men, it’s a conspiracy to enforce an operation against him. Dude is out here playing 8D chess.

Punjab police officer pursuing Imran Khan’s assassination case succumbs to heart attack

I was naive, an Ak.47 only has 30 round clip.

🔴 LIVE | Imran Khan's Message As His Home Is Surrounded by Police; Signs Point to Potential Arrest



Don't really agree with his politics, but honestly the last line hit me hard. Election ka karayen, mulk bachayen. 

However, Khan needs to sit down with the ruling coalition and make sure they plan out a roadmap for a free and fair election through prolonged dialogue on which there is unanimous agreement. Ahhh how wishful. But the reason I say this is that if elections happen without electoral reforms and all major parties not being on the same page, the next five years would be much of the same. We need elections whose result would be acceptable to everyone and that the opposition won't waste their time outside parliament rather they all will work together in the parliament.

How wishful, I am laughing at myself writing this.

So who was tweeting and starting trends priming the masses for a srilanka style uprising. Plants of ISI?

How Malik Riaz rose to power

The video talks about the story of Malik Riaz, how he rose to power, and the different links he has with the Establishment, Imran Khan, the Shariff brothers, and Zardari. The power and influence this man has is second to none.

I still remember when people here were bashing Aizaz uncle as a paid PDM shill. Judging by the upvotes, he's suddenly legit now?

The arrest of Imran Khan is an ax on the government's feet, the country is burning and Nawaz Shahbaz is playing flute in London - Sheikh Rashid

Is "playing flute" a euphemism in Urdu?

Former Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan features on the cover of Time Magazine

Has anyone actually read the article? Hope they said good things about him.

He's like our princess Diana!

A group of 100-200 people in Pakistan are holding a population 200million and its institutes hostage.

Downvoted by maryams social media cell.

He is fucked. Appearing on the cover of times is usually a curse.

Maybe imran khan is a bit corrupt?

Let me preface and say the IK should not have been dealt with the way he was and hes probably the best bet we have to fixing this country but i was listening to this podcast (the pakistan experience) and the guy was talking about how the cases against him do have merit. Apparently it seems there was a sort of quid pro quo arrangement between him and malik riaz. I’m sure someone on here knows the case better than i do but wanted your thoughts on this. What if he is a corrupt? Will it change how you vote?

Who gives a fuck. Change the status quo. 

Retake public assets from the army while allowing for prosecution of army personnel in public courts, order army to conduct its private sector businesses as non-profits and supplying Pakistani nationals their products at cost, rewrite the constitution, eliminate the archaic feudal system and redistribute lands to locals, introduce an amnesty scheme and go completely cashless using cellular phone penetration amongst the population. 

Do this and your country is fixed. It’s not rocket science. No more rhetoric politics and more actual policy.

If the case had merit, PDM would have been screaming about this ever since they came to power, like every other case they have tried to pin on IK like toshakhana.

Up until recently, never heard a peep about this case, the previous NAB chairman resigned cause he was facing pressure to start false cases. New jurnail becomes NAB chairman and this case quickly goes through and arrest warrants are sent out without much notice or media attention. 

If they just took the case to the media first without the arrest, it might have even damaged IKs reputation but the arrest overshadowed the corruption story (as well as Shehbaz and Hamzas case of similar amounts of corruption being quietly dismissed). 

The case should be heard on its merits but like ECP, cant trust NAB to do their work impartially. And as from my understanding of the case right now, while it might be fishy like selling toshakhana gifts, it might not be illegal.

The real reason for this case was to jail IK and other PTI leaders as May 14 comes and goes while preventing any major protests for the skipped election. And get PTI banned in the process

TPE is famously anti PTI and a diehard ppp supporter.

If he is corrupt, then have a fair trial and charge him. For now, even if they show Imran Khan in his own words admitting the crimes, I will not believe based on the shit that has happened so far.

When there is fair law and order then let's see if he is corrupt

He maybe corrupt, not as much as the PDM leaders. A puppet of the Establishment, that he was. General Pasha, zaheer ul Islam,Hameed Gul, Faiz, and bajwa, all of them helped him become what he is today. 

Let's see what now comes. The army is against him now and is trying to bring him down.

&gt; listening to this podcast (the pakistan experience) 

Stopped reading from here. The fact that you took that grifter seriously is evidence enough that you lack any critical thinking skills.

Let's look at the things we do know

Malik riaz made a plea agreement with the british government on his laundered money

The british government gave Pakistan that money because it rightfully belonged to Pakistan

Once that money was in Pakistan a sealed envelope was presented in cabinet and everyone was told to sign it.

Shireen mazari complained that the contents should be reveled but nobody was allowed to know

Prior to this malik riaz was ordered by Pakistani courts to pay fine(or something similar) to legalize the land he had stolen from other Pakistanis

That money from British courts which did not belong to malik riaz but rather the Pakistani government was used to pay for and legalize malik riaz's stolen land.

These are the hard facts.

Now on the otherhand malik riaz donates money/land to al qadir university trust and on that trust are the names of zulfi bukhari, imran khan and bushra bibi.

These are the facts now if someone wants to argue that it's not a bribe but a donation then Salam aur khuda hafiz meri taraf sai because i don't want to waste my time arguing with people that are this blind. Same for those who want to argue but but zardari or nawaz. If you have concrete facts that disprove the actual case then please do correct me there.

That said i don't expect them to actually convict him for corruption in this case, at least not on the facts that i have stated because that would implicate malik riaz and that is something PMLN, PPP, Judiciary or the military generals can not afford to do because he is one of their biggest sugar daddy.

He isn't an angel for sure. He isn't a good leader either.

However, he is far better than the rats we currently have as our government.

We don't know the facts of this Al Qadir case. It is very unclear as to what funds were moved where and how. The land gift itself is in no way illegal so the whole case revolves around the 190m pounds and where they went. On one hand it seems as though they were considered to be part of the fine MR had to pay the SC, but it's not clear how that works.

Continuously post ho raha yeh do din say.

- Hmm but maybe,
- hear me out.
- I am not PDM fan but


Then goes on to repeat what rana sana told them.

Nobody knows the reality. Besides NCA has already declined if Pakistan was part of this agreement. Malik reached an out of court settlement with NCA.[link](https://www.samaaenglish.tv/news/40011100) here Hadley clearly says that Pakistan was not even part of the settlement. Why would Pakistan even receive any money?

Why doesn't the tv name the property tycoon lol the main party in this case. Geo muted Bilawals daddy Malik riaz name 5 times.

Maybe you need just the tip

I believe its about choosing the lesser evil. PTI, PDM - both are crooks in their own way.

People who are corrupt run away just like any other criminal who steals something, their first instinct is to run. Look at NS, the way he ran away and is now refusing to comeback. IK never did that, they filed case after case but he never left Pakistan. What does that tell you?

Even if Imran Khan is a 1000 times more corrupt than he is as per TPE. He is still better than all the other options.

PPP and PML are dynastic and incompetent.

A self made politician is always more competent than those who inherited politics.

Right now only Imran Khan is the only self made politician from all the Prime Ministerial candidates.

And Imran Khan is challeging the Army the way none of these dynastic politicians would ever will.

They are all crooks. Imran khan is just as competent.  No offense to anyone. God Bless Pakistan.

The Pakistan Experience, sab say zayada phudu aadmi hai. Anyone who supports PPP will sell their own mother if given enough money

when will this chooha come out of his bill? how long he can he holed up in there, the whole world can see now how brave he is and using his fan club balongaras as human shield to avoid arrest, really pathetic!!

Honestly, why are ya'll *wanting* an escalation of violence? It's insane to me how dementedly jazbaati Pakistani awaam is. 

IK, gather a stellar team of lawyers and get arrested. Nelson Mandela did it in worse odds, you can do it too. This is BS.

On one hand he says 'everything thru the courts', 'no one above the law'... bro, it's time to put your money where your mouth is.

Ehm Ehm, so democratic



Well what's stopping NS to grace us with his presence? Or do they want to hold the Pakistani Elections in the UK?

Go ahead and be my guest lol, your ganja ran away, now youre running away from elections

This is just illiterate human trash, its the same guy who used to say every month "*aglay mahinay Nawaz araha hai*"...like 10 times since PDM took over. Now he's giving threats lmfao. My advice: stop paying any attention to such *tabedar* low lives who got nothing better to offer. They have zero importance for anything and bring you down to their level too. Why bother.

So scared of elections. Bunch of filthy cockroaches.

Seriously, I'm so sick of Pakistani politics. These oldies, boomer uncles, and aunties are doing 3rd class politics. I really hope that these immature boomers die soon, and we get to see better and groomed political leaders.

To all Pakistanis who have the resources, LEAVE. I am 32 and jb sy hosh sanbhala hai yae sb randi rona chal rha hai.

I am sure establishment must be behind NS's ineligibility. /s

I wonder why PTI fanboys have never seen this angle when they are quick to blame everything on establishment.

Okay, how about this

Hear me out.

What if we all went on our way not batting and eye on what's happening in politics or with imran khan, shehbaz sherif etc and we continued to do our daily businesses/jobs while keeping focus on making money and living our lives. What if we as a whole, I mean everyone returned to do their work.

What will happen then? Do you think we'll some what be progressing towards a better economy?

Isn't most of the country doing just that? And guess what.... the economy is getting worse

So just become slaves to the army overlords and produce nice taxes for the army and politicians to just eat up through corruption while the country still suffers. Cant have the country progress even of everyone was productive if the taxes generated were being handled by corrupt incompetent idiots

This is what everyone has been doing and look where it got us.

Don’t you get it already shehbaz sharif and the army has been taking all of our money our economy using it to fund their lavish lifestyles they’re sending this money to other countries further weakening the economy the army gets a huge chunk of our budget each year to spend it on building 5 star restaurants golf courses cafes and you want us to keep working so the corrupt politicians and army officials can continue to live luxuriously without a care in the world wake up already stand for your country stand for your country’s future cause this isn’t sustainable we’ll end up like sri lanka if this goes on

If i did that then how will i prove that the guy i support is better than the guy you support. My life will be meaningless because i have failed to achieve anything as an individual therefore i must put all my self worth in to a party/man or establishment.

Personal growth and entrepreneurship don't matter Jackshit when you live in an environment that limits opportunities and works against u actively , what are you gonna innovate in when every higher up is there based on sifarishe and politics. This country and its political state manufacture poverty. On top of that u want everyone to back off the establishment and mind their own business and just "work through it" , it's absolutely delusional. We need a psyche change throughout this country.

Imran Khan’s deepfake going viral. This is yet another saazish. Please raise your voice and come out of your homes.

Brother, this deepfake doesn't have artifacts of a deepfake. Unless Pakistanis have found a better way of recreating facial expressions and body language than a Hollywood vfx artist, this can't be fake.

So many PDMers active on this sub like OP.

Not at all. First: he clarified at the end I'll bring down these Lumber's one crooks and make them to obey law.

Second: He said this because there are lot of reports around there that there's internal tussle between Asim Munir and Other rank and file and that Asim is cornered right now.

So, IK make his move in game of chess.

I don't think this clip is fake

Malikmobeen posting from other account.

Party badal di saala

Oh sure, because nothing screams "intelligent discourse" quite like using cropped video clips to twist the meaning of someone's words. And labeling oneself as "apolitical" just because they happen to hate a particular politician (mostly Imran daddy)? Brilliant. Or how about proudly proclaiming oneself as a die-hard supporter of one political party ( Patwa*i ) or the other (  Jiyala ), because that's definitely the most nuanced and thoughtful way to approach complex issues. Keep up the great work, champ.

Downvote to oblivion third patwaari

If Imran doesn’t take action against the military establishment, he’ll lose a lot of support by the end of his next term like pdm did.

Wow the corrupt govts shills are working overtime for that biryani, aren’t they?

buddy you're on the wrong sub. Khan could drop an atom bomb on the country and people would still defend it.

IK lives his life one u-turn at a time.

NGL but is IK saying he's the one hijacking everything?

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf's reaction to ISPR's announcement [Translated]

# The statement released by the Inter-Services Public Relations Department of the Pakistan Armed Forces contradicts the actual facts and reflects a poor understanding of the ground situation. It comprises a regrettable assortment of narratives driven by hatred and revenge against the most credible, popular, and largest political party in the Federation of Pakistan, Tehreek-e-Insaf.

Tehreek-e-Insaf upholds democratic values in its structure, ideology, and manifesto, advocating for peaceful and non-violent means while adhering to the constitution and the law.

Since its inception, Tehreek-e-Insaf and its Chairman, Imran Khan, have consistently emphasized the importance of upholding the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law. Our objective is to safeguard the political, economic, and social rights of the people of Pakistan.

Tehreek-e-Insaf has consistently discouraged any deviations from the Constitution and the law, opposing any form of martial law that could result in the suspension of the constitution, as well as resisting electoral rigging and interference that undermine the sovereignty of the people.

Through peaceful and patient political struggle, Tehreek-e-Insaf has grown to become the largest political organization in the country, with millions of members and supporters. Chairman Imran Khan's political ideology and philosophy have garnered remarkable backing from the people. Tehreek-e-Insaf has successfully formed governments at the federal, provincial, and regional levels through democratic processes.

**Today, Tehreek-e-Insaf stands as the only credible political party in Pakistan, gaining strength through popular support.**

# The public's reaction following the abduction of the PTI chairman from the High Court on May 9 is a result of various factors. 

Chairman Imran Khan has consistently highlighted these factors over the past thirteen months, **including gross deviations from the Constitution and serious violations of citizens' basic constitutional rights that have fostered bitterness among the people.** **Imbalances in the power dynamics among state institutions, extrajudicial measures, and economic instability have further contributed to this bitterness. The mistreatment of the largest political party and its leadership has also fueled the public's discontent, which the state has failed to address.**

Tehreek-e-Insaf and its chairman have acted as a protective shield, safeguarding the nation and the state from the negative consequences of this bitterness.

# Chairman Imran Khan has advocated for transparent elections as the solution to political and administrative crises, 

urging the nation to express their reactions peacefully and within the boundaries of the constitution and the law through voting.

# Unfortunately, stubbornness and resistance to constitutional principles have prevailed over wisdom.

The illegal and unjust actions witnessed in the Islamabad High Court (intrusion into court jurisdiction, physical assaults on individuals, and the abduction of Imran Khan) have deeply saddened every patriot.

It is worrisome that prioritizing animosity and prejudice over reason and disregarding constitutional guidance may result in significant harm.

# Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf does not subscribe to the prioritization of individuals over institutions. 

We believe both individuals and institutions are obligated to abide by the law. Therefore, instead of persisting in deviating from the constitution, it is crucial to operate within its limits.

**It is imperative to abandon any attempts to undermine the people's sovereignty and to firmly establish the constitution's decisive status.**

Imran Khan is expected to address the public today.

Imran Khan says, “they’ll arrest me again from outside the court today in some other bogus case.”

PTI Voter Base Lies with Imran Khan No one else! It doesn't matter if leaders leave or not.


PTI Leaders have left before albeit under different circumstances instead of being beaten and Tortured and their families threatened this time.

Alot of ppl don't realize this but it doesn't matter if they leave politics or join another party , The Sole reason PTI gets votes is cause of Imran Khan not the party leaders, This doesn't mean there are other good leaders it's just a fact most people trust Imran Khan and that's it.

Most PTI leadership is intact including ticket holders as they are loyal workers of the Party , Only those with a strong will and loyalty will remain now.

This should be evident from all the by elections that have happened.

Imran is a human.

Watching your close friends being forced to leave the party after being abducted and tortured must hurt him on some level too.

&gt;PTI Voter Base Lies with Imran Khan No one else! It doesn't matter if leaders leave or not.

SMQ's daughter lost the NA seat she was running up from PTI's ticket.

whatever makes you feel better bro. PTI project is dismantled and buried for good.

Anyone dare to translate or English subtitle all of it??

UPDATE: 6 hours +!!  The man is Super Pakistan!

PTI's Weak Leadership

So in the turn of senior party members leaving PTI under pressure. This trend has raised questions about the overall strength of PTI's leadership. Leadership is not just about setting a direction but also about holding the team together and effectively managing differences. It is important to remember that political parties, much like any other team, require unity, a shared vision, and mutual respect among members.

From an outsider's perspective, it seems that there is a disconnect between Imran Khan's vision for a "Naya Pakistan" and the actual implementation of this vision by PTI's senior leadership. The lack of cohesion and unity among the senior party members seems to be impacting the party's effectiveness in fulfilling its promises to the people of Pakistan.

What's your take on this? Are these departures from PTI a sign of weak leadership, or are they part of the normal dynamics within a political party? Is this an opportunity for PTI to rebuild stronger, or is it a warning sign of a deeper crisis?

I wonder sometimes if posts like these are being genuine or are they intentionally being ignorant? If PTI's leaders were leaving because of some internal power struggle or a difference in vision, your post would make some sense. But the leadership is leaving because of a continuous threat imposed by a authoritarian government and military institutions.   


This isn't some internal issue that the PTI isn't able to resolve. It is a complete failure of a democracy, human rights and systems within our society. It is more disappointing that the government has been able to create some form of doubt within people of this country over the last few weeks. I simply fail to comprehend how someone looks at the events of just this month and says with a straight face that everything that is happening to PTI and the people of Pakistan is "normal" and "has always happened". Or fails to recognize how terrible these events are in even maintaining the facade that has been the Pakistani democracy.  


There is no rule of law. Our rights don't matter. The justice system doesn't matter. What matters is what the army thinks is right. We are nothing and will be nothing because we still fail to unite and blame the real reason of our country's failure.

Don't you see what's going on? Shiri Mazari has been arrested five times, and on the sixth, she accepted defeat. Welcome to North Korea.

I’m hearing some real horror stories on what’s happening to the families of these leaders, especially Shireen Mazari’s daughter.

I think you can’t blame anyone for choosing the safety of their immediate family over politics

If they find people to fill in the spots which have been left it may come back stronger as those people must know the risks involved. On the other hand, any amount of torture might (whether psychological or physical) will eventually change any person unless ofcourse we are talking about the Sahaba. However that kind of love is nowhere to be seen now.

My god are you seriously buying into this nonsense? This is all a bloody propaganda. You think they are leaving out of their own choice? Wake up.

How is this about "lotas" leaving? 

There is little doubt that immi chan took in plenty of electables. But for a moment, look at what is happening; All cases against you are immediately dropped if you distance yourself from a certain movement. An individual who is threatened with anything and everything has to just call a conference and all is forgiven. Do people not realize that there's a complete breakdown of law? There is absolutely nothing that justifies such behavior. 

The people who DO manage to get out (however they make it happen) are immediately picked up again if they don't distance themselves from this movement (SMQ). Can anyone of us say we would have withstood this sort of blackmail? Can we stop pointing fingers and for a moment think? Rights are being trampled on and people are still content fighting amongst themselves.

That’s what happens when you rely on electables. They leave at first sign of trouble(not counting Dr. Mazari)

Imran Khan not being allowed to leave IHC. Reports of shooting outside.



Their last pathethic attempts to somehow declare emergency in the country.

There is big mischief at play here. Hope he stays safe.

Question

Okay, if Imran Khan comes to power again. How will his government and army relationship will be? 
After all Imran Khan have been saying army is corrupt, so why army will trust Imran Khan.

ideally, give him 2/3rd majority and let him clean out this army, just like Erdogan did in Turkey

he will prob bend again tbh, the smart thing to do would be to change this whole system but that may be too much to expect from one man

The sad reality of our country is Army Generals along with judges and civil bureaucrats is going to stay and protect there power. In developing countries like Pakistan democracy has not matured enough and so these people will continue to rule no matter what happen.

You can never take power from them with street protests. The only way is if country unite. The whole concept of civil war, agitation does not work at all. This is there ball game they going to beat you in it. They can always bring TLP in it to counter other and it will become TLP vs PTI and you know how far TLP ca go.

IK think the country is entirely PTI which is wrong, all parties has there representation to some extend and without all on board you cannot end establishment rule in Pakistan. 

If you remember army supported one group of politicians against other and thus there is always someone to move to establishment side and crush the other for while until next coin flip.

IK current stance is going to end PTI future as party unless he agrees to terms where no party ask or take support from establishment. This is what PPP and PMLN did. They quashed out establishment support against each other. This now you have PDM with all there weakness they are in power. Because army was unable to break them even through 3 years of PTI rule. There was several opportunities for PPP to get seats and cabinet positions but they declined.

PTI now have choice where it dump establishment and agree that they join that narrative of never asking. Army help. IK currently want pre 2020 role of establishment where they were on one page. What ever he say for public consumption is opposite to what his back door negotiation and desire to meet CoAS tell otherwise. What he should work for is establishment that work under parliament.

PTI from yesterday clearly lost a ounce of support it had within establishment and establishment will now put it full force againt PTI. This is going to end not well for Pakistan or PTI. It is not good for democracy. 

I am pretty sure IK will be released, disqualified and he will be removed from party chairman similar to Nawaz. And both willl stay off politics unless there is nation consensus.

Craig Murray on Imran Khan, the powerful and the CIA



The CIA or our own ghadar fuaj and intelligence agency?

He’s right. It’s now or never Pakistanis. If you want your country to get better you will HAVE to fight for it.

At this point we’re against everyone establishment army police it’s only us we need to protect Imran with everything we got

Craig Murray's knee-jerk reaction is to blame every intelligence instution known to mankind. 

This is a dumb take and everyone knows it. The CIA dgaf bcos it doesn't have any power. Pakistani military holds all the control....they will do *whatever* it takes to stay in power. Sometimes that looks like joining hands with the US during '88 and '01, while sometimes it looks like propping the Sharif Brothers/MQM/Afghan Taliban. They work solo, they're a rogue entity. They're powerful enough to do so. The constitution of Pakistan gives them that power... the politicians have given them that power...the people of Pakistan gave them that power over 75 years. 

Here, I'll throw you a curveball. What if the CIA wants to install IK cos he's more reliable vs the army? Pak Army has stabbed the US in the back numerable times...POV of the US; they suck. The fracturing of different political groups, the maligning of the army...seems engineered if you ask me.

Like down that line blame everyone except the actual problem.

Muh CIA “overthrew” him with the Pakistani parliament removing him with a valid vote of no confidence

Absolute meme country

Perfect example of blind leading the blind.

Imran Khan says Pakistan’s economic crisis requires ‘surgery

https://on.ft.com/43FnX4S

Well, if Shaukat Tareen is going to be the FM, we will have a butcher rather than a surgeon. While at this point Dar is almost completely responsible for current economic situation, the roots of the current economic crisis is the FY2021-22 budget which began the slide of the forex reserves. Over 10billion USD loss from Aug-21 to Mar-22 iirc.

Joke time: IK has been in politics so long, he could have taken a group of the smartest school children twenty years ago, given them the best education, helped them get the best work experience in the world, so today we could have some competent finance ministers.

Imran Khan has said Pakistan will struggle to break out of a cycle of debilitating debt repayments without reform, as the country’s opposition leader and former prime minister warns the debt burden on low- and middle-income economies is becoming unmanageable.

“Whatever we do, when we look ahead, the debt is growing, our economy is slowly shrinking,” Khan, whose Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party is favoured to win national elections this year, told the Financial Times. “From my party’s point of view, we’ve started thinking that we’re stuck.”

Pakistan is in the middle of one of its worst economic crises. Analysts have said the country, which is struggling to revive a roughly $7bn IMF lending programme, is at risk of defaulting, while its foreign reserves have fallen to $4.2bn, less than enough for one month’s worth of imports.

Khan said the government needed to break out of borrowing cycles that have held back developing economies but ruled out a default if his party returned to power, saying it would prioritise domestic reforms over seeking debt relief.

“Is the answer getting more loans, or is the answer to restructure the way we run the country?” he said. “We have to conduct surgery in Pakistan in the way we run our government.”

Khan said his team was developing a strategy if he returned to power in Pakistan to juggle loan repayments and domestic spending.

“We’re sitting with our economists [on] how to come up with a plan with which we can sit with the IMF and give them a viable way of being able to pay our debts,” Khan said. “But at the same time, our economy should not be choked so that our ability to pay debt goes down.”

Khan, however, faces a barrage of legal challenges that could prevent him from running for office if convicted, including allegations that he unlawfully sold gifts he received while serving as prime minister.

Pakistan is an extreme example of the debt burden saddling low- and middle-income countries. Campaign group Debt Justice warned this week that poor countries were facing their highest bills for debt servicing in 25 years. Pakistan’s scheduled repayments on foreign public debts are equivalent to 47 per cent of government revenues in 2023, the group said.

“It’s not just Pakistan,” Khan said. “Once you start borrowing in dollars and you have to service your debt in dollars, if your dollar income doesn’t improve or increase, how are you going to then pay your debts?

“Unless we increase our dollar earnings to exports, I don’t see how we would be able to service any debts in Pakistan, whether it’s Chinese or Paris Club or commercial debts.”

Khan, who served as prime minister from 2018 until he was ousted in a no-confidence vote last year, said his plans included restructuring lossmaking state-owned enterprises and boosting the tax base.

Many of Pakistan’s economic pressures started during his time in office but have worsened dramatically in recent months. Inflation rose to a historic high of 35 per cent in March, and the dwindling foreign reserves have created shortages of essential goods including medicine.

Though Khan took some steps towards reforms while in power, many said his economic agenda failed due to mismanagement, erratic decision-making and pandemic disruption. The former cricketer, who once said he would rather die than “beg” a superpower for money, agreed a deal with the IMF in 2019, only for the programme to stall after his government backtracked on cutting energy subsidies.

Khan is engaged in a bitter stand-off with arch-rival Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, whose government has been unable to agree a reform plan with the IMF. While the fund argues that measures such as removing subsidies are necessary to stabilise the economy, Sharif’s government fears they would hurt the poor and bolster support for the populist Khan ahead of elections.

Even if Khan prevails, many analysts are sceptical he will have the political strength to overhaul Pakistan’s flagging economy.

We have an economic structure which is globally uncompetitive,” said Abid Hasan, a former World Bank economist. “Some of it will have to be dismantled . . . You will require huge consensus. The PTI alone will not be able to do it.”

requires a resuscitation, transplant followed by high dose chemo, surgery aint enough unfortunately

There is no point worrying about long-term economic policy if the elected government is toppled before the end term. Stability is the foundation of any economic strategy. No one is going to invest if they don't know what the future holds. Has Imran Khan proposed any remedy for this?

IK can do nothing if awam isn't the one standing behind to fight to any extent.

Well well. Had he not put Shaukat Tareen during his own time as FinMin, we could have agreed that PTI is really serious about resolving the debt crisis. PTI was running the economy well, before they allowed Shaukat sahib in.

It requires public hanging of the corrupt elite.

well start by booting out the feudal landlords, mafias, kartel bosses and fake mullahs who oppose all economic reforms from the PTI.

This country is yours. Your future is at stake. Stand up for your freedom. If the government refuses to release Imran Khan today, gather in Islamabad by tomorrow's Friday prayer. I face the risk of being shot on sight, and this may be my final message to you. - Murad Saeed



People have unrealistic expectations from Imran Khan. No great leader is 100 percent perfect.

All the great leaders throughout history had their flaws....Abraham Lincoln, Kemal Ataturk, Mahathir Mohamad, Ghandi, Churchill, Napoleon....nobody was perfect. They all had done or said something questionable at some point in their political careers. I support Imran Khan because he is, to say the least, much better then the Sharifs or the Zardaris. But let's be honest. He is the best we have had in years and if(God forbid) we lose him we will not get a leader like him for another 50-100 years.

I am making this thread because I have seen a new trend where people be like, " I support Imran Khan but blah blah blah". Guys we need to 100 percent support our beloved leader. He is our last hope. If(God forbid) he is killed my faith in this country will be buried right next to Imran Khan's grave. So heartbreaking :(

It’s funny how people believe PDM is doing this, PDM wouldn’t be a day in government if it wasn’t for hafiz and establishment

IK has done more than enough. He can drop dead right here right now and the real puppet master will still be punished. now its the people's turn top do their part.

Alot of emotional sentiment there. Well you can love your great leader. You can clutch pearls that if he goes away that you probably wont have another great leader. Not to say how ridiculous is the sentiment or requirement of great leader.

Yes every great leader had their flaws. Lincoln (Ended slavery, won a civil war), Attaturk (Preserved his land and Founded Turkey) etc etc.

Great Leader Imran has done what exactly? His achievement is that people have alot of hope that he will do something?

Do you know how much shit these great leaders you note had to face?

No I dont have unrealistic expectations. I have very real expectations. I will vote for imran despite all the faults as you note that he aint ppp or pmln. But the guy in my district is still going to be a dynastic politician.

Imran when he comes might maybe stabilise economy and real state would again become an important but nationally useless industry.

Human rights will be rolled back, dissent will be tamped down, dreams of authoritarian presidential system will come back.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1709522

So yes, imran will be criticised and that will not go away. Prayers to him staying safe against establishment but he is still flaunting the law.

Matlab i can go on but i got egg fried rice to eat.

You can say what you want about Imran Khan, but you can't say he's not honest, sadeeq or ameen. 

I, with my whole heart believe, the only reason he is in politics is because he wants better for Pakistan. And that he doesn't care about becoming rich and making his familiy rich too. Which I can't say about any other politician.

Sure he made mistakes in his political career, and keeps making mistakes but atleast he's not a hypocrite or a thief.

&gt; Guys we need to 100 percent support our beloved leader.

Okay I'm sorry but this is cringe af, imagine someone talking like this about Nawaz Sharif. They're politicians ffs not prophets, please treat them as such.

The day I saw someone getting a surgery over 200k for free because of his government, it was kinda hard not to support him.

Khata hai tau lagata bhi tau hai

Hard to agree. If I were you I'd remove atta Turk and Churchill from the list of GrEAtS

Kemal Atatürk was a great leader? Oh god...

Why Imran khan failed to create Niya Pakistan



You criticize Imran Khan for not creating Naya Pakistan in 3 years, but you do not ask Nawaz Sharif for not building a hospital good enough to treat his platelets and his daughters cosmetic surgery in 30 years!

THIS is Key,   


This is the grassroots issue we need to address before anything else or anyone elses efforts matter.   


Imran khan really is a true visionary and knows how to lead a country like Pakistan. corruption and illiteracy have plagued this country and both of these principles are REINFORCED by those in power to stay in power for the last 75 years. Untangling these issues takes time and with setbacks, and lessons along the way.   


Love to see people criticising IK for the way he does things from their OSP bubble.   
On stuff like why does he repeat the same thing in every jalsa.  
well buddy that is what got the same people who were manipulated and tangled in this corruption to start seeing things a bit more clearly. It united those on the fence about PTi with those who want the betterment of this country. It reiterated the core foundation of what naya pakistan is about and drove in to the souls of the defeated pakistani population. It gave hope outside a bleak future for those who dont even have food and water let alone internet wihtout the need for any facades that others employ  
Something redditors like us would never be able to do or deal with this kind of a population and its issues.

A successful Nation/nationhood cant be build by a single man/ party. It needs help of all states departments including judiciary/army to realize this dream.

Absolutely right. How can we expect to get an honest leader when we as a nation are corrupt and dishonest.

😂😂😂

Do u think decades upon decades of corruption can be reversed in just 3 years??? A successful nation needs every party on board, PTI/IK is alone

Next time, shouldn't just take in people like Gandapur, Pervez Khattak, SMQ or Pervez Elahi in. IK himself might be OK person, but his team, is all corrupt and from same old dynastic parties.

Since 40 years why they are fail to create a Proper Pakistan?

Irreparable damage to already fractured leg

I am worried that the way the rangers dragged Imran Khan from his wheelchair and forced him to walk into the van might have caused irreparable damage to his already injured leg. Do you think a full recovery from this kind of damage be probable?

As long as the blood supply is not compromised, it will be fine. If it was re-fractured, he would not be able to have even walked as far as he did

What good is leg after he is hanged?

Zalmay Khalilzad's Curious Shift towards (so called) Prosperous Pakistan

 In a thought-provoking turn of events, let me say that Zalmay Khalilzad, reputed for his CIA connections and his role in Iraq and Afghanistan, is seeking the removal of Army Chief Gen Asim Munir just like a few people in Pakistan. Notably, Khalilzad's history reveals a critical stance towards Pakistan, leading many to question his sudden interest in so called prosperity of Pakistan. I believe that his motivation stems from a desire to prevent Pakistan from aligning closely with China as the [delayed CPEC railways project is picking up some pace](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-china-silkroad-idUSKCN1LQ1KR). Previous govt x Faiz x Bajwa establishment was firmly in the US side with criticism of Russia(Bajwa), [criticism of CPEC](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-china-silkroad-idUSKCN1LQ1KR) (Govt in 2018 and Razzaq Dawood), not to mention catastrophic idea of [giving afghan national citizenship in Pakistan](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/9/17/imran-khan-pledges-citizenship-to-afghan-and-bangladeshi-refugees) and [bringing back Terrorists](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2330584/govt-releases-over-100-ttp-prisoners-as-goodwill-gesture) for the pleasure of Faiz x Imran. This whole mess was always in United States' interest as we all know that a prosperous is not in America's interest at all.   


But suddenly US congress and CIA assets Zalmay Khalilzad and people like John Bolton taking interest to make a prosperous Pakistan(according to them) by [pushing Asim Munir out.](https://twitter.com/realZalmayMK/status/1660721643461787648)   
Please note that after the take over, CPEC deals are shaping up, [trade with Russia](https://www.dawn.com/news/1732677) is also underway, [Iran has also going to setup a 100MW powerplant in Gawadar](https://www.nation.com.pk/19-May-2023/pakistan-iran-open-new-chapter-in-relations).

Imran Khan could have remained politically significant for at least a term or two more, but politically circumstances, establishment's influence and most importantly Imran Khan's post vote of no confidence political decision ushered in his political end prematurely.

Are you from the future? If Allah wills it, anything can happen.

 Lol. Leaders don’t finish like this. Even if they charge him and jail him. He will come back

PTI era is coming to an end, IK era is getting started and its here to stay.

&gt;Imran Khan could have remained politically significant for at least a term or two more

are you for real? without VONC, IK was finished. he would not have been elected for another term due to inflation alone. but thanks to the establishment's foolishness he IS politically significant. inflation and corruption are even more rampant which makes him look like a saint.

&gt;but politically circumstances, establishment's influence and most importantly Imran Khan's post vote of no confidence political decision ushered in his political end prematurely.

politics was always troublesome in Pakistan (and anywhere else since the dawn of time), we now get to see our true masters and their true colors. we didn't choose it but we did take the red pill. it indeed is a political end but for the establishment's influence.

What you said is military and PDM’s wet dream and it will remain their wet dream.

To those who deny that removing Imran Khan was planned by America/the west (albeit executed by the fauj), why?

I’ve heard conflicting opinions here and was curious as to why. 

For me personally, as soon as the VoNC was proposed I knew who it was. People here often defend journalists like Imran Riaz Khan, Waqar Malik, Arshad Shareef, etc but don’t realize that these journalists also believe the plan was concocted by America. It just seems inconsistent. You stand up for a journalist by explicitly stating that they do good reporting (and as a result are being silenced for it) but then deny their take on the core matter?

I’ve spoken to many people on the issue and all of them agree that America had a hand to play in it. The ones who suggested the lowest level of intervention by the US simply stated that the fauj wants USD; to get that they’ll need to give bases; to do that they’ll need to remove Imran Khan as Imran Khan is against the bases being given. They believe that America’s wants are limited to the bases exclusively (key element of this POV). Couple that with the fauj’s greed/corruption and removing Imran Khan makes sense.

On the other hand some say that America is hellbent denuclearizing Pakistan. That coupled with their agenda to promote degeneracy to Islamic countries (begherti, fahashi, etc) made for the perfect “two birds with one stone” act. As to the former claim of promotion of degeneracy, they believe that America is exclusively anti-Islam and will do whatever it takes to stop the ummah. It starts with small things like NGOs and promoting secularism then builds up to the abandonment of religion as a whole (key element of this POV as Pakistan is known to be the only country created on the basis of religion). As to the latter claim of denuclearization, they believe that America, as part of its anti-Islam sentiment, will never accept a Muslim state having weapons capable of rivaling themselves. The idea is that the United States planted corrupt politicians to make the country go bankrupt as soon as possible. They will provide aid in doing so by keeping the laundered money in America or another western state. Once Pakistan is on the brink of defaulting/financial crisis, America/the west will swoop in and offer to make all of their monetary troubles go away in exchange for the termination of the nuclear program. And while all this happens the American/western media will remain silent so as to make themselves not seem complicit. 

Then there’s everything in between. Believe it or not most people believe in a mix of the two (leaning more towards the second one as it plays into the religious aspect of it). They believe that the US/west is the hand and the fauj is the chess piece. Where do most people on this sub lie? These were sort of the extremes of the opinions and there are more middle ground ones as well. I’m curious to see what they are.

I thought it was my turn to post this BS today.

Because IK himself recently confessed that the US probably had nothing to do with it. There doesn't seem to be any reason to believe they did. To those who believe the Fauj wants to give the US bases, please show us where the bases are. It's been more than a year now, if that was the intention it would have happened by now. If you think the whole game was to get ammunition and arms for Ukraine from us, they likely would have gotten those under Imran as well. He doesn't seem to have shown any anti-Ukraine sentiments or denounced the ammunition that the POF has been supplying. Face it. It was just a VoNC. Benazir didn't lose hers when the Fauj was openly against her. Imran lost his. Difference being how they structured their parties and how Imran filled it with politicians whose votes and loyalty Jahangir Tareen bought for him. Others in his cabinet were just more rats that jumped out of the PPP and PML-N ship for opportunity. Stop believing conspiracies. PDM outplayed him by waving money in front of guys who joined him specifically for money. The Fauj sat by and did nothing because they saw their own benefit, being the assholes they are. From the perspective of Foreign countries, Pakistan was going underground in the last days of PTI as well. If they really wanted to destabilize us, they'd have stepped back and done nothing.

And did you just presume that "we" respect those journalists? They are just clickbait artists pretending to be journalists. The issue is, PDM always had the numbers to topple down. IK's government was what we call "besaakhi ki hakumat". It was bound to fall as soon as numbers were not in his favor.

IK was removed through a "democratic" process. I do believe that some shady deals were made, and some people were bribed for their vote. But it wasn't the army storming into the PM's residence or surrounding the parliament's chamber during the voting process to put some sort of pressure on them.

That said, the army was probably involved, since something big like the PM being removed can't happen in Pakistan without the army's explicit direction or tacit assent. But there are two possibilities here. Either the army was already involved and forcibly keeping PTI's governing coalition together, in which case they were already interfering in politics. Or they weren't involved in keeping PTI's coalition together, just that when the VoNC happened they didn't try to stop it.

And you don't need foreign intervention for this to happen. Or do you believe that the opposition was content with being in the opposition, and if not for America's involvement they wouldn't have tried to get IK out of power?

Lastly, some American diplomat saying that there would be consequences if Khan stays in power is considered a coup? Laughable that people actually believe that. Expressing that your country will not have good relations with another country if the leader of that other country does things you don't like is an obvious thing. In fact, you don't even need to say this, it's implicitly understood.

Let me put it this way. IK, while he was PM and even after he was removed was asked about relations with India. His response was, and I am paraphrasing here, that relations with India were not possible while the BJP was is power. Is this considered a coup attempt against India? Or is it just someone saying something obvious; good relations with another country aren't possible when the leadership of that other country does things you don't like.

The guy said he was helpless af when in govt. and then says that the country's most powerful institute needed the world's most powerful country to dislodge him using a democratic process in a country with history of hard coups? 

And this is just the tip of the iceberg.

The only way you can win with a conspiracy theorist is to outcrazy them

What if IK himself with his contacts to jemima and goldsmiths concocted this drama because he didnt wanna pay for his poor economic choices. PDM aa k phass gyu and IK hired  a firm to reassure amreeka that all is good. Fawad ch just met donald lu a few days ago and IMF is giving PDM such tough time and not signing the deal. IK was behind all of this hawwww.

See how easy that was.

IMO what happened was IK and Biden didnt get along because of CT policy difference. PDM was always in touch with the Americans. Specially in Karachi.  IK went to china and then Russia. Biden lobbied Pakistan to side with the "west" IK said no. Then the Americans spoke to bawja who said I love the west and don't even like noodles. After bawja and Showbaz met and went forward with VONC.

any shift in the Pakistani political landscape is approved by the US state department. change my mind

Because Amreeka has never ever meddled in another country's internal affairs. /s

I don't know what to believe but I do remember what I saw:

Embassy cars rushing to Askari 1 the evening following the VONC, followed by news of Ilhan Omar (US Congresswoman) in Pakistan. I still sometimes wonder why that was, and why I was foolish enough to not listen to a policeman enforcing protocol. Their 4x4s would have steamrolled me.

Actually.... I think this is a coup. A coup to replace the army with IK. The only thing keeping Pakistan uncontrollable was the armed forces, they did whatever they wanted (screw ANYONE, as long as it benefited them). Money don't talk to ppl like that. IK wants them out, US wants them out. Enemy of my enemy is my friend. 

The CIA and IK joined hands, sent out planted stories, dominated social media with narratives about how evil the Paak fauj is, the fracturing of dyanstic party support. Now you have IK, a complete outsider, super-popular and suddenly he abandons the cipher story?! This is the engineered Asian Spring, u guys. 

Fauj is forced to kidnap, loot, move assets over seas, abduct And black mail judges and politician? 🙁

My take is that America may have played a part but was not directly involved. Imran policy to have zero tolerance for having American bases in Pakistan and I then I think with the whole Russian Ukraine conflict where the USA asked Pakistan to provide support to Ukraine was also rejected by Imran. I think that the USA knew Russia would attack Ukraine well in advance, and they played their cards accordingly. In exchange, Pakistan would have gotten money, which the Pakistan army was eyeing many many months ago, but Imran refusal got him on the bad side of the Army. 

So whether it's America or Yahoodi sazish, understand that in the end, it's the collective involvement of all internal stakeholders. Imran Khans' introduction of Nation Security Policy, where Pakistan was first and Pakistans interest, was protected was also something that was not welcomed by the army or the USA. 

We can blame America all we want, but it will not change the fact that America did not break law and order. America did not bribe the justice system. America did not float policies for the real estate in Pakistan. America did not break the education or health system in Pakistan. It was all Pakistanis running for elections with their elite buddies. 

I have said this before that Pakistan Army could have controlled all of Pakistan with their puppet political parties without much backlash if people were getting their basic rights, access to free quality education and health as well as justice, safety and proper wealth distribution/prosperity.

You can go back and check the news from last \~1 year of PTI rule, American ambassadors and other high ranking officials had several meetings with Opposition party heads both inside and outside Pakistan. Compare this to the fact that famously when Joe Biden became President he didn't even call IK. 

It's an open secret that US was involved in the self styled regime change operation, it's also jarring how quickly *everyone* involved here in Pakistan went amnesiac the moment American name started getting dragged thru the mud (remember tv anchors shouting CYPHER until they were blue in the face??)

I bet our custodians got a direct call from Capitol hill or whereever and they were like 'youse guys gotta take one foe the team here fam!' and our boys, ever so loyal, were like 'don't even mention it papi' and too dat arrow. Pretty cut and dry if you ask me.

Done by fauji, sponsored by America lol.

USA didn't plan all this out, but it was in their interest to have IK gone because he was refusing military access and setting up to buy cheaper commodity from Russia to help the economic situation.

They are already well aware the army runs things and it also happened to be that Bajwa really didn't like PTI either and wanted to keep ties with USA. They simply offered him some incentives for getting IK removed, but obviously they wanted it to go without a hitch so army helped generate the VoNC instead of doing something dumb like a straight coup.

The thing is, that's all the USA wanted, they don't care what happens after so long as PM and army was friendly and stays there.

All the fake cases, assassination attempt(s), harassment, kidnapping, torture, etc. is 100% on army. They (and their political buddies like PMLN) want IK gone permanently because he's still a serious political opposition and even with rigged everything, will cause backlash and outrest constantly.

IK himself has had multiple positions on the matter ranging from "Amreeki Sazish" to "Only Bajwa did it", so I guess it's all BS.

Imran Khan is a product of the very system he rails against



&gt;However, it’s unlikely that Imran Khan is the best candidate to address the undercurrent of anger at the country’s systemic issues.

Assuming that this commentary is sincere, and not a bad faith, one-sided piece that makes claims without evidence: expecting perfection before progress is self-sabotage. Imperfect people, even those who are "products" of the systems they fight against, are behind every positive movement in history.

And? So is Nawaz? So is Shahbaz?

The difference is that one is wanting elections. The other has literally disobeyed the law, continually has delayed elections and doesn't seem like has any desire to ever have one.

Is it better to have democracy with a flawed product of the system, or Facism and dictatorship?

You don't go straight failing tests to an A\* overnight. It involves a steady progression as you improve processes in the background to make it easier to be better. 

The "elite" in this country are nothing more than a concentrated reflection of of the common man.

Every politician in the history of Pakistan was launched by military and that’s what wrong with Pakistan and its shit ghaddar army.

Imran Khan writes a letter to the President of Pakistan with a chargesheet against the former Army Chief Gen Bajwa.



Is this the most public, clearcut and extremely official way Immie has come out against Bajwa?

Lets gooo

IK's valentine day letter to Bajwa.

I pray to ALLAH that Bajwa gets tried in the courts and it shall set a new precedent in our country of holding the powerful accountable.

I really hope and pray that Bajwa will be tried in court for the things he himself admitted to have done. (I know it's wishful thinking but Allah jb chahta hai tu waselay bhi bn jaty).

Even though this is mainly him taking revenge and it's a personal feud, this move is very much welcome as it may finally set a new precedent in this country of holding generals accountable and stop them from behaving like they're some superior form of human who is above the law.

All the points listed in the letter have merit and should be investigated, without doubt. 

But this is Pakistan, who will do the investigating? The Army with their vested interests, the intelligence services (who report into the Army first), the judiciary (who are riddled with Army influence), politicians (who are either on Army payroll or blackmailable by the Army). 

I'm not sure what IK expects Alvi to actually do here. Alvi can't investigate personally. He'll have to form some kind of Committee of  the various above mentioned stakeholders to do the actual investigating. Thats if Alvi bothers to do anything at all. 

At this point it seems IK has realised that there is not going to be any reset in relationship with the new Army COAS, he's now openly embracing the new reality. 

Can anyone explain how IK thinks he can get near to a new Government by openly taking on the Army? 

And before you say he's not taking on the Army, but just Bajwa. Remember that Bajwa didn't act by himself, he would have taken into account the views of the top leadership team in the Army. That top leadership team is still there, even if. Bajwa is retired.

Those Generals and Corp commanders definitely don't want anyone digging into their past decision making and criticising it. 

I don't think this is going to play out well for PTI's future aspirations.

There is very little chance of bajwa facing justice. He has likely moved his haram money abroad and won't return. Second the army is institutionally corrupt and wont let one of its own go to jail. It sets a bad precedent since most of the top brass are corrupt.

Black Vigo picking up Khan sahab in 3.2.1....

Fauj uses Pakistan constitution as toilet paper, but they have secret videos on judges to keep them in Line. Public hanging of Bajwaa is badly needed for awam to have some confidence in the impotent and incompetent judiciary.

Good. IK is still taking baby steps but Im glad that were going in the right direction.

He should also write about how Bajwa and Faiz lent all sort of illicit support to IK and PTI, both before and after the 2018 elections. Heavy handed political interference.

All parties are in agreement on this. Glad IK has got the ball rolling.

IMO, all of this is meaningless unless there is policy and political unity to end military influence on Pakistani politics. 

Bajwa is not the sole reason for the demise of Pakistan. IK/PTI fanboys had nothing but love for the army when it was on their side. Heck, they allowed for the passing of the "don't criticize army" law....under which, allegedly, someone has been tried/jailed (the guy on Twitter with like &gt;200 followers). People have been raising the alarm bells about the establishment for years but that was all "aMeRiCaN cOnSpiRaCy" and "trying to bring down our honorable Pak fauj". The level of delusion about "its our only institution that's competent" - yeah, no shit, Sherlock... agar itnay paisay aur power ke baad bhi kaam na keray tau laanat aisi institution par. 

Even now, the conversation is about BAJWA going to trial vs actual policy-making/law to curb the influence of the military (political &amp; financial). I'm sure PTI/IK and the rest of the stooges can agree that undue military-establishment influence has destroyed democracy in Pakistan time and again. That's literally the only thing they all have in common - as soon as any of them are ousted, they throw tantrums about it and point fingers. 

Let's see what happens.

Didn't he say he was ok with isi taping his conversations ? So what's wrong with bajwa having those tapes . most other things have benefitted him for quite some time too

&gt;Khan said, adding the question that arises is who gave him the power to decide that an elected prime minister was supposedly a danger to the country. The PTI chairman noted that only the people through elections can decide who they want to elect as prime minister.

They used the same power or authority that they used to install you and countless before you and later overthrowed them because they were danger to the power structure established by them.

They dont care about elections neither now nor in 2018.

Pres wont do shit. Write it to ICJ.

Yeah, Immi chan might be ded this time.

Never in the history of pakistan have i seen any SANE or LESS CORRUPT politician, bureaucrat or army personnel🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ none of them ever proposed a policy that ACTUALLY was far sighted or fruitful for Pakistan. Neither in terms of infrastructure, business nor education and science

Belcha..belcha..belcha...belcha

Topi drama. Army will never let anything happen. Worse case, they will ask Bajwa to retire in some foreign country. 

It is clear that Bajwa and Imran had hatred for each other as neither liked the other. I wouldn't be surprised if Bajwa submits a charge sheet against Imran.

Will the beneficiary of Bajwa’s meddling (IK) will also be punished?

Banana republic

General’s power eroding slowly but surely. It’s not a sprint guys, slow and steady does it. Keep plugging away and maybe in a decade or so we can put this fecking jinnie back in his damn box!

I am skeptical, this might be a fake

Zaman khan ma karkunan na security Tate Ker di

As much as I want this to be true however still I question  myself on the authenticity of this letter, no letterhead no signature. Is it a clickbait?

Very good. A step to right direction. Let start it when he become the chief.

Bajwa traitor kuta must pay for his crimes.

Finally, he's done being manipulated.

You have better chance of Billo going straight than Bajwaaa facing justice, Bajwaaa has whole corrupt institution of fauj standing behind him. Billo also wishes to have Fauj standing behind him but for a different reasons.

Wasted time and paper both.

President's office receives a plethora of letters from disgruntled citizens. It is humanly impossible to cater them all. However the office must answer for acknowledgement when receiving such Valentine's Day letters.

bajwa is such a cunning person

Imran Khan: ‘Gov’t even willing to violate Pakistan constitution’

Governments violate citizens every day.. 

The Constitution is just a piece of paper. You can wipe shit with it. If the constitution had any value, things wouldn't be this bad to begin with.

Man, they have screwed everything over. The constitution is like the smallest thing to them.

His party did the same when trying to dissolve the national assembly during the no confidence vote. The same judges termed that act as non constitutional.

TIME Interview with Imran Khan



Respect to IK for actually agreeing for interviews like these. You cannot buy these western and can’t really control them regarding the questions they ask.

I mean that’s probably why the PDM bastards never really give interviews to these international media outlets. Bunch of pussies.

IK’s public speaking skills are his big assets. Not just that but also the bytes he gives to media houses. He knows the international media looks for something new and crunchy than the ones before. So he’s always playing around with them.  He also has depth on the international issues so he knows how to connect them. Like how he was the first Pakistani leader to speak on climate crisis as a major challenge for Pakistan or Islamophobia. He’s an interviewer’s dream.

PMLN people be like: itni angreezi wo be parchioon ke ilawa, how is this possible

PMLN shot themselves in the foot

They have created a situation where they have a life long animosity with Imran khan. The situation has gone so extreme that they know if they let PTI back on the stage they wont be able run and their political career (dynasty) will be finished. Even PPP has tried to sideline themselves as much as possible. 


Why couldnt they just wait for the election. PTI would be the one facing this economic crisis. PTI popularity was already going down until this drama happened. Now Imran khan has more support than ever. 


Too late now lol.

They are hoping IK is somehow disqualified. Their future depends on it.

That would involve them having some sort of long-term vision. Judging by their governance over the past few decades, vision is something they don't have.

It's much more serious than that. Not only will their political efforts go to waste, but they will be criminally prosecuted for the rest of their lives. Everything they have built for themselves and every bit of corruption they did to get where they are will all be for nothing. Even though they will always be wealthy, they will forever be on the run and/or exiled. 

Furthermore, all of their partners in crime, those who broke the law knowing that they had the approval of PPP/PMLN, are all at risk if IK comes back to power. Everything they have corrupted for will be at risk and they have to protect this at all costs. Removing IK from the picture, at this point, is the ONLY option they have in order to remain safe themselves. This is why Sanaullah said either IK gets murdered or we do.. You can already see this with the assassination attempt and the spreading of dangerous narratives to incite hate and violence between the people. 

So, I do agree with you that PMLN has shot themselves in the foot. Not once, but many times. They have created a situation where the danger to IKs life, and the PDMs existence, increases by the day. Both cannot survive.

Greed and the fear of a COAS appointment against PDM forced their hand !

They had been trying to get VONC since the start but when they got the greenlight from bajwa they pounced without thinking and they definitely did not anticipate that first american sazish jalsa had it not happened they *might* have gone for election but with each passing day khan's popularity grew and theirs went into freefall. Their only hope is a disqualification which isn't seem to be happening.

They are waiting for a technical knock out which is the modus operandi of the establishment but it's not coming, hafiz shaab only knows for sure why that is.

They did not have a choice, GHQ said it was this or NAB cases.

PPP and PMLN have been leeching since the 80s.

If Pakistanis are too thick to have not noticed by now, it really is worrying what it will take.

The PDM need to be chased into the sea

PTI would have lost the elections easily had their government stayed. 

Now, PTI is the one making same mistake. Let the government run for a few months. Global situation will improve in coming few months.

I honestly have no answer to this question other than sheer greed and a blind lust for power. I'm also fairly certain that the GHQ was trying to appease their daddy Amreeka by trying to oust Khan. Not that it worked. If anything, the IMF is even less eager to talk to a government that may not survive until the end of the year. 

That said, I've lost a lot of respect for Khan since he became the GHQ's rubber stamp. We voted for this guy because he wasn't one to back Down. Instead, he ended up being a tool for Papa John's until they no longer needed him and flung him aside like a spent casing. Only then did he remember institutional boundaries. 

And mark my words, the moment a General decides to support Khan, all will be forgiven and the GHQ-PTI bonhomie will be back in full swing. If the GHQ can do one thing right, it is to STFU and stay firmly OUT of politics, come what may. But that won't happen. They enjoy playing kingmaker too much, and they have too many financial investments to ever allow meaningful financial reform. 

Pakistan is well and truly lost at this point.

Pmln got trapped real bad. And Khan's narrative building strategy is working wonders

IK started this war when he singled our NS as the root of all evil under the instructions of his masters from back then. Which is also why PMLN fell into the trap the army later set for IK once he became too rabid to control for them. 

Not to condone what PDM is now doing but this fire that's now burning the country down to cinders may have been started by the wardiwallas but the match was firmly in IKs hand when it started.

If I were PDM right now, I would let IK come back to power and move overseas for 2-3 years to avoid his revenge. IK or anyone in his team has no economic plan and his whole political narrative revolves around PDM and establishment bashing. Once PDM is gone and establishment is quite, he will fall from grace very soon.

They know Imran Khan will die in next few years and after that all lotas would join them back ...

pti were already facing economic crisis - thats the narrative  pdm went with when doing no vote confidence..

No lessons learnt from the East Pakistan tragedy — Imran Khan tweets



They did the same with Mujib. His home was surrounded by the army firing live rounds. They killed his watchman who had refused to flee and abducted him to prisons in Lyallpur and Lahore. He was in jail when his nation became independent.

If they learned from 71 they wouldn't be interfering in our democracy and resorting to illegal measures all these 52 years.

NaPak Army will be the biggest blight in this country's history, the black death plague of Pakistan.

Enemies of Pakistan = Pakistanis

The lesson was that elite and Lumber 1 wanted Bangladesh out. They precisely learned what they wanted. The plan worked as it was intended.

Ofcourse they learned their lesson. Didn’t you hear Bajwa’s farewell speech? It was the political class that attacked East Pakistan with guns, it was a political failure and he saluted the soldiers of the time.

I see a business opportunity here. PTI can repurpose these in to water bottles. Anyone onow what these canisters are made of ? Maybe these can be converted into mini planters or pencil holders or something..

Or collect them all and sell it to a recycling plant..

East Pakistan was a completely different situation where the bengalis were held in contempt by the sindh and punjabi elite and bhutto lost an election that was he was rigged to win

This battle is feudal landlords, tribal chiefs, pir's, mullahs and kartel bosses of the PTI vs feudal landlords, tribal chiefs, pir's, mullahs and kartel bosses of the PDM and to top it off both sides are married to each other or have relatives on both sides so this is just a stage show lol  

as always the elites eat cake whilst poor die on the chessboard.

Countries like that have revolutions.

the what tragedy?

What does this tweet mean in regards to the safety of Imran Khan?

https://twitter.com/travelgov/status/1657711635761430529?s=48&amp;t=YqbwS22y0puaF93pJ8J1eg

Keep IK safe everyone support him!

They’re going to arrest IK and his wife and the US embassy is bracing itself for the backlash. Shit is about to hit the fan and make last week look like a walk in the park.

Protests

Hi Everyone,  


Sooner or later Pakistan is gonna run into chaos since we all know that PDM and the Establishment are not gonna give up their power and will ultimately do something really stupid. ALLAH na karay asa ho but we all know by now what kind of filth we are dealing with here. When that happens please don't let anyone burn down cars and bikes or shops of innocent people. Even if the shop owner is a billionaire. I just saw a post on Reddit where protesters were burning a Mcdonald's and to me, it makes no sense. People need to realize that we all have worked very hard to make these assets.   


Years ago there was a protest in Quetta by an Islamic Party and they started burning and destroying things. They burned my car down which took me almost everything to buy at the time. It also had sentimental value as it was something my Dad was really proud of and had so many pictures with because it was something his son bought with his own hard-earned earnings.   


It's been more than 10 years now I guess and I still don't have a car and the way the car prices have been going up chances are I am never going to own one. The struggles I have had to go through and the opportunities I have missed just because some idiot thought burning my car would make the WEST angry is unmeasurable. So please don't hurt the average people in the protest no matter how angry you are. MAY ALLAH BRING PEACE TO OUR COUNTRY! Ameen. ALLAH Imran Khan ko apni hifazat may rakhay! Ameen!

Just surround GHQ and Corp Commanders house and demand COAS to resign. 

IK  needs to try splitting the PDM alliance.

sorry that happened to you. if its public vs establishment on the streets, shit's gonna get ugly

The Israelis and the French are better than us complacent Pakistani souls.

Surroung GHQ.
Only option.

The right to assemble and the right to protest is a basic human right.

Don’t lose this voice 
Raise your voice first and actions will follow.

You lost your car, but still have closeted support for protests. Why not just say that protests should be avoided completely and democratic rules be followed, even if they mean that you might have to stay out for 1.5 years? Why not just come back stronger in the upcoming elections without any besaakhi this time? As soon as party starts protesting, they lose all my support. I have seen riots after Benazir's assassinations and they were the worse time I had seen in my life. Same should  be for you and all the sane Pakistanis.

Private Property should be strictly off limits. If you burn a citizen’s car or their business, it doesn’t hurt the government and the establishment.

What hurts the government is the mass strikes, civil disobedience, and transport shutdown. Make anyone associated with them a pariah in the society.

IMF cuts Pakistan’s growth forecast, sees hike in inflation



&gt;The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reduced the economic growth forecast of Pakistan to 0.5% as well as steeply increased inflation projections far above 20% for two years -- underscoring that the people’s hardships would not end soon and interest rates might remain at their highest levels.

Thank you Army/PDM

Soon enough, if the zameer is still intact, we would take to the roads. Might as well start a protest against the govt altogether, instead of coming out for a political party or a person. Maybe, just maybe, we can once come out for the common man of Pakistan and their everyday anxiety and hardship living in lawless country.

More inflation. This ain’t enough?

The whole world is projected to go towards deflation in FY24. Who wants to bet Pakistan will still have double digits inflation thanks to our incompetent government?

Oh well.

The Bhutto/Zardari and shareefs have their wealth safely secured abroad so who cares?

The awaam are too coward to stand up these guys. In fact, you *STILL* have clowns who even bootlick them.

Summary of the Events in Pakistan of the Last year... Share and Learn why people are protesting

**Summary of events from the last year. **

Because of state run propaganda sources within Pakistan or news outlets using Pakistani journalists tend to run state narratives so some headlines alter or mislead what has been happening. 

To clarify terms. PTI is Khan's party. PDM is the ruling coalition made up of 2 intuitional parties PPP (Bhutto family) and PMLN (Sharif family). The Establishment is the top branch of the military

**April 2022:** Military and political allies remove Khan's government through a Vote of No Confidence

1) **State claim** The incoming government and the VONC was an organic democratic movement.

**Reality:**

[Gen Bajwa facilitated no-confidence motion against Imran: Khokar](https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2023/01/02/gen-bajwa-facilitated-no-confidence-motion-against-imran-khokar/)

In Urdu language interviews the former COAS Bajwa has admitted to continual involvement in politics and continued claims of Khan being a threat to Pakistan, and his removal would "save" it. He deemed Khan as a threat to the current order of Pakistan, which is military control.

Khan initially was reserved in the militaries role, but over the last several months has outright accused many high level generals including the then General Bajwa, to be involved in his ouster, influencing and threatening politicians and judges to get there way.

It was revealed in an investigative report (outside of Pakistan to avoid state censorship) that Bajwa himself was engaged in massive corruption scandals.

Their are many possible reasons for Khan's removal but a large one seemed to be to amend the anti-corruption laws in the country and to basically give relief to any potential future corruption charges against the COAS and several politicians in the government coalition PDM.

Most analysts agree to the military's role

&gt;[**Khan’s ouster was the latest episode in a long saga of intervention by the Pakistani military in the country’s politics**. What is novel about the current situation is that the military itself appears to be divided in its attitude toward Khan. This is likely to fuel new cycles of instability in Pakistan](https://thewire.in/south-asia/pakistan-army-corrupt-politicians)

Several other sources from PDM members confirm the military involvement. 

One BAP member claimed he would be end up tortured like a PTI member if he told the truth. Another member on TV channel admitted it was impossible without the military. Most of this is not allowed to be in print media.

&gt;As most observers of Pakistan know, the hybrid model tilts **the balance of power toward the Pakistani military,** which chooses the dynastic political party that will come into power. It is an unwritten rule in Islamabad that the military generals in Rawalpindi have the final word

&gt;[The old political establishment is desperately clinging to power, with the support of the military, by preventing Imran Khan from running for office. Khan’s political party, the **Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI), enjoys overwhelming support from the Pakistani middle class and, most importantly, its youth. Many analysts believe that if elections were to be held soon, the PTI would win overwhelming support.**](https://thediplomat.com/2023/03/imran-khan-threatens-pakistans-military-civilian-hybrid-model/)

2) **State claim:** Economic reasons were the main reason of Khan's ouster and he was unpopular

**Reality**

Oct 20 22: [Imran Khan appears to be more popular than ever](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/10/20/imran-khan-appears-to-be-more-popular-than-ever)

Even after his removal public opinion polls showed Khan would likely win the next election, since his removal that popularity has increased and went from a likely small majority to a overwhelming 2/3 majority based on most independent polls.

In terms of economic performance, several key economic indicators showed the government was working well on most matters. The only issue was a short term period of inflation, post Covid and Russian War.

**State Claim:** New government is here to stabilize the economy

**Reality**

Pakistan's economy has essentially collapsed in these last 12 months. Which adds credence to Khan's allegation that the government is only here to relieve their own corruption cases. 

With increasing inflation and increasing economic problems Khan's party continues to gain more support, and the people desire to voice their frustrations through elections and protest.

The state does not want either to happen, resulting in the political crisis we have today.

3) **Gross Human Rights Violations in the last year**

At several points over the last year the people of Pakistan have wanted to peacefully protest and voice their complaints about the government. 

A long march is one example of a traditional protest that happens with most governments in Pakistan, giving the opposition a chance to pressurize the government. By law the right to protest is allowed in Pakistan. 

During the PDM/military tenure, their has been a increasing rise in attempts to protest which have been met with crackdowns, state brutality, kidnappings, censorship, and even deaths.

Seeing the inevitable results if any election does happen, hundreds of cases have been filed against him and his party members in an effort to influence the election or prevent him from running.

[Pakistan: 37 cases filed  against Imran Khan across the country, charges include sedition, blasphemy and terrorism](https://www.opindia.com/2023/03/pakistan-37-cases-filed-against-imran-khan-sedition-blasphemy-and-terrorism/)

The ruling coalition has admitted this strategy that an arrest will be beneficial for them.

&gt;[Now if Mr Khan goes to jail … it will be much easier for his opponents, especially the PML-N, to manage the election in Punjab....Mr Khan will be in jail and the PML-N, which currently is enjoying better ties with the powers that be, is better placed to go into polls in Punjab](https://www.dawn.com/news/1742265/hamza-back-to-claim-his-stake-as-cousins-campaign-picks-up)

Supreme Court is defiant elections will happen, and likely defeat of PDM in polls

**May 9:** Khan arrested

Khan enjoys support from the majority of the population of Pakistan. This includes the most educated, working class, woman, urban, minority etc.. For most people Khan and his party represents a chance for the middle class to have a voice that is often lost in Pakistan, as most things are dominated by the super rich or influential (military). His support base continues to grow mainly due to this divide between the classes. 

His party policies are often debated even among his supporters, but most people simply view Khan as a much needed first step change to a broken and rigged system.

Well done! Very informative

Good info

I am not a strong supporter of Imran Khan. In a normal democracy, he is dangerous. However, in Pakistan, it's more complicated.

This might be a controversial opinion here but I definitely do not mind some (civilised) thoughts on this. 

I am not a supporter of Imran Khan because I believe he incites his supporters and his populist rhetoric is dangerous in the long run. My opinion on him turned very sour after the No Confidence Vote -- I felt that the weird attempt at manoeuvring through the vote by declaring unconstitutionality and the behaviour/precedent he set of an opposition staging mass-scale protests whenever they're ousted from power (which PDM definitely co-opted) is dangerous in the long run. I also think that he often plays the same political games as his opponents whom he derides. And while I share common cause with his opposition to corrupt institutions, I do not subscribe to his populist rhetoric. In a normal democracy, I believe he is dangerous (along with his opponents). In Pakistan, I have a nuanced take.

While I do not like Imran Khan, the corruption he is accused for in this case, if it is true, and may be barred from politics for is really not at all different from the other politicians. If he has to be barred from politics, then so should 90% of the government and military's top brass. The fact that this isn't happening means an unfair bias permeates and is very undemocratic.

Whatever my opinions on him, I respect the right of others to support him. Furthermore, while I think IK has his problems, let's be honest: given the history of the military, there's no doubt they played their hand, even if I believe this is the single most democratic ousting of a PM in the country's history. But it is only the best in relation to the previous track record of this country, which isn't saying that much. It's a step in the right direction, but people have a right to be angry that it happened. While I thought his ousting was more legal than any previous ousting of a government, I never favoured the vote in the first place, believing that he should be finishing his term at least instead of the opposition creating instability for personal gain. 

I will admit that initially I thought Imran Khan's reaction to his ousting was excessive, and in some ways I still do, but seeing how the army began the politically motivated court cases despite the terrible state of the economy, I now think IK's actions may be a necessary evil. An evil, I emphasise, but one that may be needed. The fact that the army is focusing on playing revenge against Imran Khan rather than fixing the economy...I was always had my issues with them, but damn, this is just a new low. They cannot blame IK alone for all this violence. IK may incite his supporters, but the army gives clear reasons to fuel the incitement. The army clearly has their power gone to their heads, a position I have maintained for a long time. 

I am not currently sympathising with IK in this situation because I support him; I just want the right to look at his name on the ballot and not vote for him, not have the army make that decision for me.

IK trying to dissolve the assembly was a mistake but credit where it is due, he picked up his diary and left the PM house once the SC doors opened in the middle of the night. PDM on the other hands refuses to acknowledge the SC, blatantly violates the constitution and nothing happens. IK gets charged for talking against a judge whereas a certain incompetent spoilt women gets to say what ever she wants about the judges.

IK isnt perfect, but the way everyone, including the army, police, judiciary and the establishment is trying their best to bring him down is what infuriates everyone. IK having to go through all this while a certain haramkhoor enjoys his life in London is just a slap on every ones face.

One can respect that even though your claims about democracy are stupid, if you consider your vote for PMLN(the only party that attacked the supreme court once physically and one like today) or PPP (party that didn't follow democracy against mujib lol, party that has a chokehold on karachi and getting away with not following democracy) both together going against elections. But ppl are still better than those who stand on the wrong side of history and are against elections, those are lowest of the low. Totally agree if you hate IK show him in vote.

I will for example never celebrate the killings of PMLN supporters by lumber1. Although PMLN is a murderous party itself since the 90s it has killed muhajirs, pathans, model town and now this. PMLN itself is a brainchild of Zia hence darkest of them all.

IK dismissed the non confidence resolution based upon it being a non democratic maneuvering..now since everyone has accepted it was in hindsight was he wrong??

No he wasn't 

He dismisses the resolution and did order snap elections like it should have been.


There would have been no consitution violation or any of problems we have today if that was allowed 

You can't make a govt with majority party being out

Breaking new records of bagharatee as usual, like father like daughter....  
At least it explains why bloody mary is so detached from reality and lives in a bubble as this guy is just insane...

A proven money launderer and absconder from the courts is giving lectures on what is acceptable or not ... WOW.

How about you grow a bunch of balls, come back to the country where you fled from with your tail between your legs, bhoonku ganja

So he's medically okay now? Like, no heart problems, stress, or platelets going down? Isn't this stressful for him? Also, with what income is he supporting himself there for 4 years now? Altaf used to survive on chandas MQM would collect here. What medical conditions should we expect from Dr. Adnan if he returns and PTI comes back in power? These are all questions our dear N friends should ask themselves and their Quaid.

Absconder should First return

Why is his opinion even relevant?

Nawazu pehle tu mulk me tua aa, Tera ham unacceptable nikalte he

Bao G ki platelets puri ho gai??? 🫡🫡

Listening to his BS - unacceptable

3 judges are not enough to decide if one man ECP is violating the constitution? Even CJP alone should be enough for this.

So this is how the new narrative is gonna be. 

Now they are sure the result is elections in KP and Punjab. They will blame it on the Judiciary for the mess that they themselves have created. Also make way for his own arrival and call out ex judges. Keep beating that narrative until Qazi Faiz arrives and bails him out for National Elections.

They will not sign IMF or at least use it as subsidy or some other ploy to gain voters back.

Nawaz dont matter.// hes a convict ; hiding in the UK

Bhaag DK Bose, DK Bose, DK Bose Bhaag Bhaag DK Bose DK Bose DK Bhaag…..

Who cares what a plateless absconder has to say. He should come back and voice his discontent from behind bars. Coward.

Fun question...

Who would you rather have for your PM...?

Billo raani or *Barray Mian Sahab*...?

I would say Mian sahab because I have a feeling Billo *sirff khae gee aur lagae gee nahin...*

*Imraaniyay reply karrnay say gureez karain...*

checkmate

Well if you put your bias aside he is right, if pti themselves are saying they don’t have a problem with full court then why is the cj adamant on listening this case with a three judge bench especially the other two judges being the ones on whom objections are being raised why not settle the matter and make a full court?? And to explain to my pti friends why a proper judgement on this is necessary is that whoever wins these elections will be incharge when the general elections are held this would give rise to easier rigging to whoever wins these elections especially the Punjab as the notion has always been whoever wins Punjab wins Pakistan. Anyhow just imagine n league winning as despite your delusions they have historically had a hold on Punjab due to their work there, wouldn’t you accuse them of rigging the ge held in Punjab if they are in the govt at that time??

I say this as a realist not a fan of Imran Khan or his politics.

So TLP, Jawad Ahmed and Sugar Daddy Tareen. 

Nice. Let's see which party gets $$$ from the army and corrupt shits..

Dirty Harry is a psychopath, his mental balance is not right, he is abnormal -Imran Khan

Funny how I was watching ARY during this speech and ARY muted the speech, whereas BOL didn't. Fuck ARY all my homies hate ARY.

“Ye logo ne meri hifazat karni hai? 
Khatra hi inn logo se hai”

Kinky Harry.

Who is this perv harry?

He just named "Dirty Harry" which I don't think is any registered name in the world but in reaction, ARY got banned, BOL is on target, Police reached to arrest him.. But Maryam Nawaz not only name called judges and courts but also spread their pics on social media and still no legal action.. PTI may have done its blunders but it has exposed this system really well

Dirty Harry probably has a fetish at this point.

Not a fan of this guy and his own actions the past 5 years, but he’s obviously right. What kind of sick minded military tortures it’s own citizens, makes sex tapes of its politicians, constantly uses institutions to bully its government? This is truly abnormal.

Finally people believe what he is and has been saying all along. Too bad people realized when it was too late.

 IK getting riled up, this guy aint slowing down, a cornered tiger, 1992 World Cup final all over again, you try to push this guy against the wall, he will break the god damn wall

Who is dirty harry?

&gt;his mental balance is not right, he is abnormal

Damn, I thought you were talking about Imran Khan.

Why are ppl in the comments assuming Dirty Harry = something sexual? Am I missing the joke? 🤔

Cos it's a Clint Eastwood movie about a vigilante cop... which is what I assume IK is referring to, like someone else who is like Dirty Harry.

A  psychopath calling other psychopath! not able to  call by name. Lamer!

Yrr koi aaj bta de mujhey ye Dirty Harry kon hai? Aur ye Mr. X kon hai? Please dono naam saaf saaf likh do! 🙏🏽

IK: Main sirf eik Allah se srta hu
Also IK: *skips zamqn park when 2 policemen come from Isb*

I wasn't alive when Imran Khan won the world cup for Pakistan,

But Inn Sh Allah I will be alive to witness Imran Khan winning back Pakistan. 


This is the moment we were all waiting for. I very sparsely use the term now or never because it takes away from its gravity. But right now is the closest we have come to our goal. We can't turn away now because there are real consequences and blatant propaganda by state sponsored media will continue to drive their narrative down people's throats. 

Faiz Isa is waiting around the corner... 

Everyone I urge you to try a bit harder, no matter where you currently stand on the scale, weather that will come from attending more rallies, attending your first one, talking about it to someone, exposing corruption around you, uniting others to spread facts and disprove misinformation/propoganda. Be apart of the change so when you witness a better future for your children, you will know your efforts mattered. 

This is literally it, I can see the finish line for the first time, but not before a huge massive abyss.

Hope!!

&gt;I can see the finish line for the first time, but not before a huge massive abyss.

No where near the finish line imo. I hope I'm wrong.

Han g Imran khan should win everything. He should take the bullets for us while we should all be chilling at home. The only way forward is to peacefully protest.

Remindme! 1 year

unless and until people take to the streets, nothing is changing. Tahreer square scenes in front of lumber 1 HQ is one way, Sri Lanka like invasion of parliament and PM house is another way.

I hope you are right, but IMO you're are being a little too optimistic here. We are not close to the finish line.

Even if Imran Khan wins the election, what will stop the military from toppling the government again before the term ends, like has been happening for 75 years? Has Imran Khan proposed any systemic reforms to prevent this?

Inshallah!!

What does the future of Pakistan look like?

I turned 18 two weeks ago and to be honest, I have some concerns about the current state of affairs that make me question the security of my future in Pakistan. The recent events surrounding the arrest of Ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan have left me feeling uncertain about the direction our nation is heading in. Additionally, the restrictions on social media platforms and the reduction in internet bandwidth have made it increasingly difficult to stay informed and connected.

What are your opinions on the future of Pakistan. What are your hopes, fears, and aspirations for our country? I have a future ahead and I don't want to risk it for a country that doesn't care about it's citizens at all.

Well, people lived like this from 1947 to 2007, then we kinda stopped at 2010 for a few years and now we’re traveling back in time

It's the year 2050. The world nations have started exploring the cosmos. Population on earth has fallen to 2 billion. Weather throughout the white blue planet has become arid due to extreme heat. Some 10,000 km away, there lies a country tucked between India, China, Afghanistan, and Iran. The country has gone through some of the most extreme heat waves where temperatures reach 50c. It's 12 pm, and you can see the city come to life. As people wake up from the slumber to shake off the tiredness from sleeping late drinking chai. At 1 p.m., shops open, and there's some hustling and bustling on the street. As vendors set up their stalls.. Oh wait, as vendors drop their shutters and quickly run to the nearest Mosque to pray, Zuhur. It's, 1.30 pm. Lunch time. People dive into consuming savory naans and nihari. 2.30 pm people start to reopen their shops. Sellers gather and try to voo their customers with the goods. Each is trying to sell and make 0.0001 Satoshis enough to put 1 meal on the table for the family. 

Some few kilometers away, we housing societies with roads bustling with cars, rickshaws, and busses. Slight wind blowing hiting against the skin as sweat evaporates,  we see soldiers standing with their Ak47 tightly held in arms looking at every move. They protect the commander and work directly under the COAS. 

It's 4 pm. We hear a protest breaking in the distance. People gathered around known personality. They are seen encouraging  the people to ask for their rights. The gormint must adhere to the demands of the people. 

Down the line, we see a huge digital billboard displaying Mardana Kamzori ka Ilaaj bitchoo pani mein hai. Call now 090078601

&gt;18 two weeks ago

Happy Birthday Kiddo!!

Dude we cannot predict like one day let aside future.

Our existence is in danger, now either Imran Khan will remain or us. For this we will go to any extent and then we will not even think about whether it is democratic or undemocratic. Rana Sanaullah



u/TinkeringDave anything to say? Come spit more bullshit about how IK is the same as these guys

This kind of crap is designed to incite their supporters to murder. This is why they constantly spout the 'fitna' narrative. The real fitna is PDM, a band of thieves who have taken control over the country.

Lol..so basically they are running away from people.

This guy is just big talks

wait for PDM shills to explain how that is fine.

waiting for PDM shills, hicks and motherlovers to explain and defend...

This janwar should have been hanged years ago. He has always been the most heartless attack dog of PMLN

I felt the instinct that I didn't know that I had it in me!

Hope Pakistan can clean up its accumulated trash COMPLETELY this time.

r/saveVideo

u/saveVideo

Its a game of thrones all right.

Shaitan bhi rana sana ullah k samne sharminda hojaye. Khabees admi

u/TinkeringDave, u/Sir_Oligarch, any words on this?

Finally! Speaking the truth. Something that was also true last year.

Imran Khan will do Jalsa in Lahore Minar E Pakistan



I fear they might try to assassinate him again. His security proved laxed as he was literally shot in the legs. I mean part of me wants IK to do Jalsa, but I am also shitting in my pants with fear that our beloved leader might end up getting shot. I feel helpless and hopeless about the situation :(

Ah yes, Minaar-e-Pakistan. The safest spot for IK to be. 


Lets hope they prepare well for his arrival, speech and departure. This is going to be a tough one for the organizers and the security agencies to handle.

Lets hope the Lumber one dont take away the coverage, the aholes postponed the march to the same day IK was having a Jalsa. They always figure out something to take attention away from IK rallies.

# Evil clique: "Can we try to Benazirize him AGAIN?"

But why ? People already support you. A dharna will not add any value except make you and your supporters an easy target. Why not start campaigning and creating policies on how you will fix shit up if you are re-elected ? Discuss austerity measures and provide information to the people on why the IMF program is important or not important. Discuss what changes you have made in KPK and Punjab. Highlight all the good you did. 

In my eyes, Dharna is not going to call for an early election. They have already decided that elections are not happening anytime soon.

Maybe I am failing to see this. Hopefully, someone can chime in and explain the perspective.

i’m frm india imran khan is right wing or left?

The Govt decided to start proceedings against the 3 member bench in SJC.

this is their counter to the SC decision. seems like they arent backing down, and looks like tbey want to remove CJP. what are the chances of this happening?

They'd all be tried under contempt of court and disqualified like Yousuf Raza Gilani.

My guess is deep down they actually want something like that to happen, becoming *political martyrs* is the only face-saving they can get at this point.

Legally none. But this is Pakistan land of possibilities. So anything is possible.

Imran Khan announces to re-start the election campaign with Lahore rally.



Well I'm going. Found myself company for the rally. If the fascist govt gets me, that's it folks.

Route for tomorrow's rally led by Chairman PTI Imran Khan at 2 pm:
  

  
Zaman Park (canal bank road), 
  
Iqbal Road (Garhi Shahu), 
  
Railway Station, 
  
Brandeth Road, 
  
Circular Road, 
  
Shah Alam Chowk, 
  
Lohari Gate Chowk, 
  
Urdu Bazar Chowk, 
  
Bhaati Gate Chowk, 
  
Datta Darbar.

See you tomorrow Kaptaan. F these bastards.

He’s pissed.

Boy is pissed.

You can say what you want but you can't say this man is not sincere, to his country, to himself. He has absolutely nothing to gain risking his life, staying away from his children, but still he sacrifices himself for his fellow countrymen. What did we do to deserve him? Nothing !

Aaannndd section 144 is imposed

Yar jaise yeh log hain dobara marne ke try keraingai

This dude can stay home and play call of duty all day and still get elected

Unfortunately, IK is a dead man walking!  He is lucky so far due to some insider tips I guess...

But the root of all evil is pretty determined and it is well aware that a cowardly dead nation won't rise! Remember the history of Fatima Jinnah to Benazir Bhutto.

I hope to the core that I am proven wrong.

This caretaker government was made to take care of PDMs interest, judiciary in a coma, ajeeb chutyapa

Called off. Section 144 imposed again. Allah Naqvi ko pochy. That son of Zardari is a pathetic human being.

Can you please share the original link to the video? Thanks!

Pakistani Americans wonder why the US media fails to see the Imran Khan they see, understand and love. Answer lies in understanding politics of Pakistan's traditional English speaking chattering classes that exist at the interface between Pakistan and the west.

An article titled "**Pakistan’s Imran Khan: Islamist and Anti-Islamist, Playboy and Women Hater?**" was published today by Moeed Pirzada, discussing the perception of Imran Khan. 

It highlights how Khan is often misrepresented in the English media and liberal circles in Pakistan, with some accusing him of being anti-Semitic and having sympathy for Israel, while others label him as an Islamist. The narratives are often shaped by personal biases, political motivations, and a lack of understanding of the complexities of Pakistani politics. It also questions why Pakistani liberals, particularly those in the diaspora, are seemingly resistant to political change in Pakistan and continue to demonize Khan.  

An excerpt from the article:

&gt;So while 99% of Pakistanis instinctively understand that the assassination attempt on Imran Khan (Nov 2022) was not the act of a lone religious fanatic for any supposed blasphemy but of a trained shooter who was either acting on behalf of elements within the Pakistani establishment or the current government – and for purely political reasons. But this abundantly clear perspective is found missing from the liberal’s commentaries.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pakistanis understand that Khan, when he talks of “Riyasat-e-Medina”, is not trying to resurrect a 7th-century Islamist social order but is only trying to offer a European-style modern welfare state and that he continuously refers to Britain’s NHS and Scandinavian Health models. And while he quotes examples from Muslim history, he quotes even more examples from the US, UK, India, China, Switzerland, Singapore, and so on.  
&gt;  
&gt;Liberals paint Imran Khan as an ultra-conservative, someone against women’s education but fail to tell their readers and Western interactions that Khan’s four sisters had the best education and were professional working women. Rubina Khan studied at the London School of Economics and worked for United Nations, Aleema studied at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) established export-oriented businesses, and does fundraising for NUML where free education for girls is an important component. Uzma is a surgeon in Lahore and Rani Khan, after university, works in charity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Liberals fail to tell Western readers that Khan’s opponents (PMLN and PPP) represent patriarchal values where women are mostly part of the households or social butterflies. Liberals make selective use of Khan’s different statements to prove that Khan is a misogynist but fail to tell that Khan’s party, PTI, has for the first time mobilized Pakistani women into politics, that Khan’s political rallies are full of women, and young girls and that before Khan’s rise into politics, Pakistan’s political rallies were only for men. Liberal’s selective amnesia fails to tell western audience that in patriarchal world of Khan’s political opponents men once divorced run away with their sons and wipe out all memories of their ex-wife, but Khan and Jemima Goldsmith maintain a relationship of respect and affection twenty years after their separation just like in the post-modern west. And Jemima is a name loved and respected across Muslim Pakistan.  
&gt;  
&gt;And liberals fail to remember that for the first time, Pakistani women, on the night of 25th May 2022, were part of fierce street fighting in Islamabad’s D-Chowk where all night they fought and resisted police that fired thousands of tear gas shells. This was again the situation around Zaman Park (March 2023) when police came to arrest Imran Khan and women were part of the activists that resisted and failed the police.

This is interesting take.

- PTV was just recently running some paid molvi that said "yeh tu musalman hi nahi" Lol

- In my family there are pmln boomers that share weird forwards where they are calling him Qadiani and share pictures of Jemima and others to potray him as qadiani etc. They also call him playboy. Ngl in pmln boomers it's a very very strong narrative for their hatred.

For local Audience specifically pmln boomers he is a yahoodi or a non-muslom. For western world he is an anti-semite and an Islamist.

what a cope and deflection most 'pakistani americans' are not your pindi ibad 'liberals' but emigrants who worked their way up in the US, a nation that treasures meritocracy

&amp;#x200B;

also stop taking our money if you hate us so much

These munafiq English speaking liberals on a payroll by the powerful elite is the reason why Imran is hated in the west, pdm have years of experience on how to lobby the west and understand how important america is to influence Rawalpindi. Imran only recently understood this and hired lobbying firms in USA, while pdm were doing everything they could to portray themselves as the liberal saviors and Imran has the extremist who will make Pakistan a theocratic state.

Lol, what a load of bs! Just the kind of thing you’d expect from Pirzada. Forget everything about liberalism, remember what IK has about rape? It doesn’t matter where IK and his sisters studied when he single handedly destroyed the future of Pakistan with SNC. IK more than anyone in Pakistan uses Islamic slogans and symbolisms to appeal to the people. He’s nothing but a politician who uses every which way to get into power. Same as every other politician. He’s not special.

What's different this time in Pakistan is the complete lack of hope

I've been speaking to some people (mostly those older than me) who have lived through a fair amount of Pakistan's history, and one thing that struck me as being different this time is that Pakistan has been through numerous crises before (dictatorships, Bangladesh's creation, extremism, countless cycles of inflation) but this time around there is no silver lining or light at the end of the tunnel. Especially for those who live in Pakistan, everyone seems to have given up and is looking for a way out. The sense of defeatism and loss of hope is unprecedented.

Previously during dictatorships, political leaders would rise to the occasion and rally people for a democratic leadership that would be answerable to them, so there was a hope of things being better - and I dislike PPP more than any other party as a Karachiite, but credit where it's due, they have been the leading proponents of this historically.

During economic crises, our leaders (mostly dictators) usually jumped into whatever war Uncle Sam wanted us to join (Ayub during Cold War, Zia during Soviet War, Musharraf/PPP during War on Terror) and that would ensure a steady supply of dollars to ride out the crisis without undergoing any meaningful reforms and everyone was happy at the end of the day.

2008-2015 was a dark period of terrorism, but to the military's credit, it got its act together under Raheel Sharif and decided to aggressively stamp out the terrorism menace, and people thought that the 'strategic depth' mentality was over for good.

I think the last year or so has exposed that everyone in this hammam is naked - the average person seems to think that there's not one person or institution (army, judiciary, any political or religious party) capable or worthy of rallying behind. 

The last hope for this generation seemed to be Imran Khan, but he failed to deliver and the whole same-page drama of the first 3 years (something people here conveniently forget to mention) proved that once he found his own feet after being in power (much like Nawaz Sharif in the 90s), he was no longer unacceptable to the powers that be and they wanted him out no matter what the cost - bringing in the same ghissa pitta faces of failure that we've seen before to replace him.

Now there's a sense, at least to the PTI faithful in Karachi that I spoke to, that even PTI/IK aren't worth fighting for, they're more or less part of the same rotten status quo. And the less said about PMLN/PDM the better - the only good thing I can say about Ishaq Dar is that he will be the final nail in the PMLN's political coffin whether he realizes it or not. I can't remember a time before when everyone was this hopeless about Pakistan. 

May Allah SWT help us all.

I guess the one major reason for lack of hope is how they feel betrayed by the army. Those who couldnt hear a word uttered against the military, now curse it themselves.

Its because they (mostly elders) thought that the military did what it did for the betterment of Pakistan.

So when they installed dictators, it was ok.
So when they overthrew governments it was ok.
So when they backed one party over the other, it was ok.

To my surprise, most people were not unaware of this. They simply chose to believe that the soldiers who fought for this country would not become the Generals and Brigadiers that would (or even could) destroy it.

So when they put Zardari on the throne it was ok.
So when they put Nawaz on the throne it was ok.
So when they put Imran on the throne it was ok.

Each time the people thought it was for the betterment of the country.

But when they replaced IK with tried and tested assholes, failures, hicks, mother lovers and sons of bitches, thats when the curtains were lifted.

People could see that, instead of trying something new, they simply brought back those who were accused and/or convicted or robbing this country.

Thats when they lost hope.
Coz agar Army bhi kutti hai, to bacha kiya?

Too much negativity dude. I would counter you and say that for the first time in Pakistan's history, there's actually hope. People now see the institutions as they really are. And people are willing to change. Have some faith brother!

Nothing to add to the post, but on a tangential note, people should check out the replies under the the tweet by Bangladesh's Awami Leauge.

If India was to look to invade Pakistan, I don't think I would be rooting for them to lose. I just want them to steam roll GHQ to the ground.

There's no final nail in pmln or pdm or anyone's coffin. Only awam can decide that, only they can bury the elite and corrupt political dynasties if they decide to take charge.

Before there was delusion that either Army or a leader will take us to glory. Now with such ease of communication in technology everyone is now realizing that they have been given lollypops only. If you take Army officers, top bureaucracy  , judges, political leader, media houses, big landlords and industrialists ( Ruling Elite) their future is safe. Whatever crisis country is facing they are unaffected, their wealth keep on getting accumulated. 

Silver lining here is that if this crisis is able to endanger their safety and wealth, they will realize that they have form a consensus to how to run the country of this huge population, and utilize its potential. Even if most of them flew I hope those who remain are sensible people loyal to country and can feel the pain of masses.

People on the other hand need to wake up and start questioning those run the government. There is only fraction of elite who are only concerned with their gain whereas there is sea of young blood that is willing to handwork but have no opportunities. They/we need to give elite a warning glance that if you keep this up we all will eat you alive.

Also I have hope with youth that is leaving abroad that they will hone their skill and make enough connections to bring back projects and business back in Paksitan after like 15, 20 or even 30 years later.

People used to be hopeful about PTI. But their 10 years in KPK and 3.5 years in federal (too less time in federal to get to conclusions), has made people think they are the same. If it's just another party why the rallying around change? Don't get me wrong, IK is better than other mainstream party leaders, but at the root, PTI is same as other parties. 

Many people voted for their first time for PTI. But they won't be doing this time.

They are planning to launch an operation at Zaman Park tonight!!!

According to various news reports and social media posts, the police are planning to launch a grand operation at Zaman Park tonight and possibly arrest Imran Khan. They are going to burn this country.

Yar scene kiya hai? Ab kis case mein arrest kr rahay hain?

what is the case? He has gotten bail in all the cases

Update?

at this point, IK should show up to the SC, hand himself over, go to jail for a day or two and come out as mandela, guys gonna get popular as never before

Bhai har dusre din yehi afwa phelti hy

How will they burn this country? Khan should be ashamed that he is letting his workers face this situation and is hiding behind them from last 6 months

He is disrespecting the law, disrespecting the courts, and then he name is party TEHREEK E INSAF

instead of being an example, he is showing how big a coward he is

good. Perhaps spending some time in jail will make IK realize the futility of his suicidal Bani Gala Gandhi Gimmick

to arrest karne me kia hai what happend to jail bharao thareek?

Imran Khan has the unprecedented manipulative and propaganda skills.

One can argue that it's the only way to fight the decay of rest of the power holders or something but one can't deny it. 

P.S: Comments only on the topic will be much appreciated.

Aaj khanay mein anday aalo ka salan hay

Bhai ab PDM ke boongion se kisi ne manipulate hona nahi? Awaam Kia kare

It is called PR and PTI is very good at it? Why? They know their supporters and how to connect with them. They dont call the youngsters "kutte k bache" and they dont call people "ill-informed".

Besides, Its easy to sell merit and accountability to the masses compared to "many countries are corrupt but they developed so corruption is not a problem".

One can argue PDM supporters still love the taste of zardri/Nawaz balls after decades and decades.

He has charisma and he has the advantage of being the nations hero proving his love for Pakistan time after time. People don’t doubt his intentions, maybe he won’t be able to deliver it cause he isn’t the best politician but I don’t doubt his intentions towards making Pakistan a strong nation.

Its more of a skill to motivate his followers, he knows what his followers respond to

The man says that the country needs to have an equal rule of law for all "manipulative and propaganda".

Lol basic human rights are "manipulative and propaganda"

*Yaar amman rooz aloo anday kaa saalun kiyun nahin banaateein...*

Nobody is ready to trust lies and deceptive tactics of PDM parties. Currently there is no better choice than Imran Khan to counter them

So, finally it comes down to this! /s

I deny it

I guess it's much more noticeable because there's nobody upto his mark in terms of rhetoric and communication. All opponents are either too dumb or too naive to build-up any anti-narrative.

Manipulation and Propaganda are part of Politics. Entire books have been written just on these topics. It would be unrealistic to expect everything that a politican says.

Most politicians are sociopaths whose primary goal is to tell the people what they want to hear after understanding their fears and insecurities. They're comparable to televangelists whose broadcasts target elderly people that live alone by telling them they'll get into heaven if they send donations to their Megachurch.

It's one of the reasons why seeing people adore politicians (and in some cases, elevate them to messiah status) is kinda disturbing.

They all are the same. PPP, PMLN, PTI and everyone. All of them are manipulative liars who’d say and do anything to get into power. They don’t have any ethics. All they want is power. Power corrupted them all to rotten human beings. Just look at IK’s speeches or interviews when he first entered politics.

Social Media Reach for PTI and PDM

Is it just me, or something is going on with the social media reach for PTI/ImranKhan and others (say, PMLN) social media reach ? Whenever I see a post by say, CMShahbaz, it's always over a million views fairly quickly, meanwhile Imran Khan's reach has fallen down to just 100-200K. Sometimes even less at just 10-20K. I have noticed this on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook ... it doesn't make any sense. 

Any technical experts can shed some light on it, if reach can actually be blocked ?

SS has an average of 10-20k views per video on insta, khan has 600k to a million

Many culprits of the same coin

A Pandora box was opened by the unresolved matters in Pakistan. A country which is the best example for a fiasco. Priorities are not in the correct order because the DNA of the country is pleasing the religion and it doesn't care about the present and future. Politics are a piece of crap ,they use and control the masses by applying the religion card. 

Pakistan should be dissolved to rethink,to start from the scratch without the overreligious mindset atmosphere. A country when nobody knows their rights, constitution but the average citizens knows about the Quran.

Religion does not provide money to buy food,to pay monthly bills . It tells you there is no equilibrium in this society. 

Pakistan has been dealing with unresolved, unresolved basic necessities because of the;
Bad leadership
Bad leadership
Bad administration
Lack of communication and integration

International intervention is a good way to restore the minimum order to celebrate new elections. Primer minister should be abolish. A presidential mandate should be best for the country, religion should be a secondary aspect.

The population 
The ignorance
Imran Khan
The current government
Are part of the culprit,the country is paying for the broken glasses because of the lack commitment.

Regards from Latin America.

Yeah, not sure this is a great take, the part about religion is way off. People do what they do because of their personal interests, not because of fanaticism (mostly)

 You don't even know the ground realities of Pakistan politics and religions.

Foreign intervention never ends well, this is an internal issue one we have to solve ourselves

I find it funny when people think the main problem is that Pakistanis are religious when I get made fun for practicing Islam when I visit the country. Yes, people use the religion card when it benefits them, but most people don't care nearly as much about Islam as you people think and there is absolutely nothing religious about the government or governmental insitutions, our instability started when we thought it was a good idea to fight the US' wars. The country hasn't seen a single day of peace and prosperity since then

Imran Khan arrested outside Islamabad court



Is something happens Nawaz wont leave the uk that will be for sure the ppl here will make sure

Imran Khan on the operation at Zaman Park: The plan is to first arrest Imran Khan and then imprison him in Balochistan. The intention is to crush the political party and ensure that a controlled election takes place, paving the way for the corrupt politicians to come to power.



The most important part for me in this speech was his words to youth that even if he is out of picture, they have to still be active in this struggle. clearly hinting that either he will definitely behind the bars after sometime OR he will be murdered. 

We tend to realize the seriousness of a situation when its already too late. if he is out of picture, we will be back to square one.

He's right, and people are confusing the person responsible. Almost all of this is because of Asim Munir and his cronies.

The kid who died in police custody was done because of those orders, the chaos created was done because of those orders.

Truly vile and evil organization and people

Government expenditure on education, total (% of government expenditure) - India, Pakistan, Bangladesh (y-axis does not start at 0)



In rural areas the waderay dont let teachers come to school. They need the mazaray uneducated.

Source: [World bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.XPD.TOTL.GB.ZS?end=2021&amp;locations=IN-PK-BD&amp;start=2013&amp;view=chart)

Pakistan 2016 really was a peak for us

Expenditure definitely matters but *how and where* it's spent also matters. 

The most important metric is outcome such as literacy rate where other two countries are around 75% but.... Pakistan, well :-(

[https://twitter.com/themapsdaily/status/1544558756175962112?lang=en](https://twitter.com/themapsdaily/status/1544558756175962112?lang=en)

Well this bottomed out nicely in the IK dor same as tranparency internationals rating.

So you are telling me IK contested the whole elections on ehtesaab and taleem and failed epicly in both ? Even worse than previous tenure on whome he criticized about not paying attention to it. Wow!

You guys just don't know but it's a 5D chess move by immi chan. Reducing expenditure on education is the way to go.

What about population bomb we're having here. And hundreds of  thousands ghost teachers

Pakistan 2016 really was a peak for us

Thanks Khan Sahab

Like father like son

imran khan

Spending money on education is one thing but that money being actually used on education is different.

We're doing much better than East Pakistan, PDM zindabad. 😎🤡

Doesn't Singapore have education as its 2nd largest budget?

Thanks Khan

I wonder if these figures are somehow for the federal government? Provinces manage education now. For Punjab, it was 485 billion for education out of 3.2 trillion budget last year. 15%. Almost similar for other provinces. Almost 17% for KPK. 

But I am sure federal government doesn't spend 10% on education. It's much lower. So, no idea what's going on in this chart. Maybe it adds all budgets from provincial and federal governments, and then find the percentage of education?

Is the Up hike due to laptop scheme by showbaz? Because I doubt we were invested in education.

So its important to note what else happened to both those economies in that time.

Education does not impact our short term stability. So regardless of government, if there's a crisis, education (along with other social security benefits) are the ones that don't grow. ***THIS IS NOT JUST A BEING MORE EFFICIENT UNDER IK THING. THERE IS NO WAY TO PROVE THAT RIGHT NOW.*** Not a hater, just someone who studied economics at a fairly high level

This is likely the result of both countries going through the following:

1. ***Covid:*** Both countries don't have large pharma industries whereas India does. This meant the governments had to spend money on Vaccines, Masks, Hospitals, testing etc. so all other sectors in the economy had less money left in them. India exported lots of vaccines so I would think they didn't have the same short term cash constraint
2. ***Debt Crisis:*** Both Bangladesh and Pakistan are currently going through a current account/debt crisis. We don't have enough money to pay off our debts (bangladesh is a lot milder then ours, and have a very quickly growing economy so its likely to get through this a lot faster/easier). Debt crisis takes precedence over everything, if a country defaults, there are lots of long lasting ramifications, so again, other parts of the economy are directed to servicing debt/making import payments. (Please look at Sri Lanka as another economy in the same position as ours)

Education is important, but in this case IK, or any political government had no impact on those numbers above. I do not like his education policy at all (and he has in the past given up education to his coalition partners) and there is no proof to say he was more efficient then other governments. The above is largely a result of the two issues I mentioned above and is something all governments would do in our situation so its not good or bad, it is what it is. The other things are the problem

A message to Pakistan in support of Imran Khan by Shaikh Imran Hussain

▶️https://youtu.be/K9QV1pIjLkI

Shaikh gave an advise. He qouted Allama Iqbal that this nation has stopped thinking for last 300 years. Also highlighted the work by Allama in his book “Reconstruction of religious thoughts in Islam“. 

Go Mujahids. Let's get back the Azan. 

Eid Mubarak.

This guy is a nobody conspiracy theorist. Don't waste your time

As much as I loved growing up to his conspiracy theories and still watch them as entertainment, I would not trust Sheikh Imran Hosein simply because of his tunnel vision. Everything to him is a sazish and everything to him is done by Zionists..

He has actively argued against covid SOPs, against quarantine (even in the video where he quotes the hadith where Prophet Muhammad asks for people to quarantine but later says that applies only for epidemic and we can't trust WHO to tell us if it is an epidemic. Only a few people here and there got ill... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1pGR5WK5W0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1pGR5WK5W0))

He has no evidence or arguments. His claim for covid being a lab manufactured virus was that Allah has created nature in truth and therefore nature cannot produce something so evil it spreads around the world. His prediction is a virus that will be coded to avoid Jewish DNA and kill Arabs.....

yeah so take that with a few crystals of bitter sea salt.

Edit: maybe this video as well. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUePEpl6FOQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUePEpl6FOQ)

"There are indications that Pakistan's parliament, which is controlled by the governing coalition, might well ask the Supreme Court to disqualify Imran Khan from running for election and even prohibit PTI in the next few days." Zalmay Khalilzad

&gt;The government appears to have decided to set up Imran Khan as Enemy No 1 of the State. Such steps will only deepen Pakistan's triple crises: political, economic, and security. Already, some countries have suspended planned investments. 


&gt;The IMF support remains doubtful.  If the steps mentioned take place, international support for #Pakistan will decline further. Political polarization and violence will likely increase.


&gt;I hope the Pakistani political leaders rise above destructive petty politics that undermine the national interest. If not, I hope the Supreme Court says no to being used in games that undermine the nation's interests. I am becoming increasingly concerned about Pakistan.

Thats the next best logical solution for PDM. Once Khan is disqualified, he will be an easier target. 

These people will do anything just to hold power. PPP can't relinquish their control in Sindh. PMLN will not give up Punjab. Balochistan is a gone case as control there is mostly under the old farts belonging to PMLn and PMLn Q. 

All these parties just want to control their respective thrones. They don't care what happens to country.

I see ptwaris on twitter screaming online about FoReiGn iNterVenTion...the same group now talking shit that was silent when Donald Lu was cheerleading a coup

They will try to whip up a nArRative  based on this but the simple answer to this incoming propaganda is

If they're *really* that certain that this is foreign intervention, then go ahead and issue the US a demarche like PTI govt did. 

But they wont :) because they will never get high on their own drugs

Wouldn't be surprising

Than Why have an election? 🙃

Kia hum koi ghulam hain..

Quite a few PDM social media mouthpieces are claiming that PTI has hired Zalmay to lobby for them in Washington.

None of them have yet brought documentary proof of FARA registration.

CIA-backed Immy

isn't he already disqualified (per ECP toshakhana decision). I thought the he needs to win his case against the disqualification in the IHC to be qualified again?

If by some miracle, Imran Khan is able to return to power, what action will realistically be taken against PDM leaders?

.

Start off by court martialling bajwa and all these army generals who interfeared with politics and democracy, IK should set an example by not politically persecuting his opponents, if there are any legal cases then go ahead, no need for 150 FIRs

Carry out actions against bureaucracy. Make them admit under oath who asked to commit the wrongdoings. 

Similarly, task FIA to interrogate all the na maloom afraad cases and investigate ISI.

I'm praying for a Nuremberg style trial where nobody is spared.

Nothing. Focus on reforming the civil service and other institutiona. Only when these institutions are independent and strong will any real change occur. When they're made independent and strong, even if corrupt people get into power they won't be able to affect much change for their benefit.

Assemble all corrupt politicians et al. in a row and carry out their execution. My proposal is that democracy should be abolised and we should embrace a merit-based system. Politicians should not be voted or selected based on charisma, but rather on their track record of serving the people. Politicians would begin with serving a small region, and work their way up based on their performance, eventually earning the opportunity to oversee larger cities and demonstrate their competence in the role and only after proving exceptional performance and competence, they may be considered for the role of Prime Minister of Pakistan.

I think he will reverse their NAB amendment and reopen their cases which they came and closed. Those cases will lead to convictions of many pdm leadership.


* He will not be allowed majority so he won’t be able to make constitutional reforms. 
* Bureaucracy, police and judiciary are so shit that nothing will happen even IK tried. 
* So in reality, he will have bigger fish to fry I.e fix the economic conditions rather than fighting an already lost battle.

Ideally we need overhaul of Army, Police, judiciary and local government system for any government to succeed.

Nothing unless the top brass of lumber one is changed and the People who ACTUALLY care about the country becomes our establishment. But its all a pipe dream tbh

He also needs to deal with the Army.

Remove Asim Munir as COAS, Remove Anjum as DG ISI and his cronies. They should be arrested and trialed. Launch an investigation into the military and ISI. 
Seperate ISI from the Army. Have it under government control, following governments foreign policy. Strengthen FIA and IB and use them to clean up the corrupt.
As for PDM. Split the provinces into 30ish provinces. Would destory ppp is Sindh. Arrest them and launch an investigation into their assets and crimes such as murder.

If you kill all corrupt politicians, there will be No politicians left in Pakistan at all.

Should his prime concern after coming into power not to be resolve current financial crisis and introduce Policies and Doctrines in lieu of his 10.point. agenda.( I liked those though). If he comes in power, he will certainly hold 2/3 majority and he will have absolute power over shutting off the loopholes in Constitution that always let corrupt slide away from the grip of law. Empower the organizations. Let them make their own decisions free of any political or military influence. 

He certainly lacks skilled team in PTI as he stands almost alone in the party and mainly has electables and Mosami people (as shown in Punjab). He shall try and break people from PDM who are good and comparatively less corrupt E.g Ch Nisaar, Ahsan Iqbal etc. They will prove a loyal asset to him both in governance and management. As well as improving the party strength. 

Then he can go after any corrupt politician whether it be from PDM or PTI. With less repurcussions and more effective and lasting hold.

First of all need to put some check and balance on army and control those few generals who are in politics. Rest everything is fine.

# Easy.... Set up a special tribunal for corruption/crimes... Confiscate ill-gotten wealth.... Give them a proper gun-fire salute while they are hanging from the highest pole in Pakistan ;-)

People need to just stop voting for PPP and PML.  We have to let them go away into the history books and never be allowed to return to our nation.

Don't see the army bugging any time soon tbh. They will take everyone with them.

Nothing, focus on ensuring that the country doesn't starve to death and we are back on our feet. Once that is done, only then turn full fascist similar to Hasina Wajid.

Maybe all sides should stop political persecution and focus on real problems that affect real pakistanis.

Stop all political shit and make changes that allow you to stop taking advantage of rules. Bring responsibility and accountability and prosecute people who fail to fulfill their role. Stolen wealth is not coming back. These boomers have nothing to their names since everything is passed on to their kids through trusts in offshore accounts. Have rules that stop officials from passing their wealth while in power. Strengthen civil institutes to have better inclusiveness and attain law and order. 

Start putting up industries. This will help bring jobs and improve the standard of living. Have better labor laws to promote healthy work environments. Pakistan fails to utilize its workforce because things are not done on merit. Women are left out of the workforce simply because of barriers erected. Take power away from the army. They need to be on the borders and maintain security and intelligence, not run the country. 

For anyone thinking, why not go after the corrupt. Well, everyone is compromised. Everyone has taken favours from each other, so there is no way they will snitch the other dude out. Remove boomers from the key positions and put younger people in charge. Show that Pakistan is a place for talent. Have mandatory retirement age on positions. Once you cross 64, the official has to retire. No stay orders applicable.

Lastly, have minimum education requirements to hold ministries and offices. At least a bachelor degree and then stringent education requirements for education and health minsitry. Remove the strangling hands of mullahs from the education and take this seriously. 

Once you have basic things set up, you can then start collecting evidence and go after the corrupt. 

All the above changes will take 10 years. You will see the improvements after 20 years. Education and a healthy workforce are long-term investments that no Pakistanis want. People want the retruns now, and sadly, this world doesn't work like this..

If you kill all corrupt politicians, there will be No politicians left in Pakistan at all.

Should his prime concern after coming into power not to be resolve current financial crisis and introduce Policies and Doctrines in lieu of his 10.point. agenda.( I liked those though). If he comes in power, he will certainly hold 2/3 majority and he will have absolute power over shutting off the loopholes in Constitution that always let corrupt slide away from the grip of law.

he just have to establish rule of law, pdm will be handled automatically.

He should work in economy instead of games to corner opposition.

Baan 💪 charhayi jaye gi sab ko

Phir wohi krna hai kiss ki saza bhugat rha hai?

Wait....isn't a proper post body(an not just the title) required? My posts that only have a title and no body text get removed by the mods pretty quickly. This one has been up for 9 plus hours? Why do they remove my posts? I am not jealous of the OP by the way; I am just curious. Is OP popular here on r/pakistan?

Bro to be frank idk whether he ll do such exterme things bcuz hes quite malleable and impressonable the most u can expect is murderers of Arshad n Zile shah put to trial. Dont think hes that stupid to throw a stone  towards hornets nest. 
so lets not get our hopes up mostly likely pdm ba#tards return the fraction of looted $$$ they get pardon or self exile. Dont think he ll go full rambo but dont expect him to be docile either but Allah knows i personally wana c zaradri, rana n maryum hanged infront of parliament that would be so bonkers.

Imran Khan won't save you

It sad to see he hasn’t taken some time to reflect on the core issue with Pakistans economy. Land reforms are needed to stop everyone pipping their money into real estate. Yet sadly in his recent speech he keeps harping on about new real estate.

My God we know who the real daddy of this country is. Its DHA and Bahria Town.

It was reported last year that the Naya Pakistan Housing project, which had a goal of constructing 5 million low cost housing units, was only able to construct a grand total of ~3700 low cost housing units for the general public, and 14000 for government employees! 

https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2022/10/16/decoding-the-progress-of-naya-pakistan-housing/

The real estate rot goes from the bottom to the top!

With all these OSPs speculating in local real estate, it has become impossible for the middle class to buy a house in any of the large cities.

Agreed. There is lot that needs to be done and real estate is definitely not a sustainable solution. 
However,

1. it aligns with the property dealer mindset of haramkhors so there won't be much resistance at least in this area.

2. We need money ASAP. Alternatives are better but time horizons are beyond the urgency

3. Construction will help other industries too. So, it has its impact on the wider economy 


Obviously, the drawbacks include another wave of tax amnesty scheme which helps haramkhors launder their black money. Then, there is the impact of speculation. There are many others but I guess you already know about them.

IK keeps talking about real estate projects probably because there's no other way the OSPs think their investment will be safe in Pakistan.

An OSP with 1 crore rs, can not magically start or invest in a business in Pakistan. But they can buy some land.

Every time a half twit economist thinks our economic problems are solely  caused  by Real eshtate  - they should itch that urge and actually go see commentary done by actual economists regarding Pakistan's economic affliction.


No real estate is NOT the sole problem - just check twitter for Atif Mian

IK was surrounded by uniform and not uniformed property dealers, yes, politicians are also property dealers, so the taught him well that real estate causes boost in x number of industries. That influenced IK vision.

A good leader shouldn't decide everything himself but should surrounded himself with right company. And hire right people to make right decisions.  IK failed last time except a few cases like Ehsas program and Pandemic handling. All other issues remained same. Almost 2.5 year the entire kept beating drum of bringing N.S in, instead of actually doing ground work for the country.

It would be horrible if IL brings in Tarin as finance minister. And I don’t know who they have other than him as the finance czar

Real estate ties down a lot of resources but that's a fight i am willing to fight another time.

IK has made plenty enemies lets not add another to the group. Its better to divide a fight into battles which are fought one by one.

I was not very happy when IK started going after everyone in his term as it gave them the reason to come together and overthrow him and pretty much undid everything. The best way is to do things one by one.

Did we actually watch the same speech or you don't have a good grasp of Urdu language? 

He was talking about how real estate is the only way of investment for people. So they will work on new avenues. Go watch it again.

How else will the OSPs invest in Pakistan?  Even we can't trust the beurucracy or institutions here,how will they?

Je every sane person knows this.

Acha hua bata dia app nay. Mayri saari tension door ho gai hay ab.

desperate times calls for desperate measures.

just let him come to power once more, he ll know what to do this time

YOU WILL STILL NEED TO DEVELOP REAL ESTATE. Real Estate development is a blanket term. Singapore has no space left yet they still need developers. You need to tear down and rebuild better infrastructure. The thing that the government will need to work on is a system of accountability. The way you break old real estate(DHA) developer is to introduce new ones (Overseas Pakistanis and International developers). All retired Pakistani professionals I know in the USA own investment properties. Strip Malls. The idea from what I have always understood is to let new developers in to break the monopolies. If contract assurance is guaranteed then these old dinosaurs have no way of competing on quality and speed with the international titans

Imran Khan's exclusive interview with CNN



Vice interviews Imran Khan



Downvoted by maryams beyghairat media cell

Is it on YouTube?

IK cannot give interviews. He blunders every interview he gives, unless it's a softball fuzzy from his favorite journalists.

Imran Khan, the supposed "anti-establishment" leader, is nothing more than a power-hungry politician who is fighting the system for his own benefit. He may have exposed corruption, but he has shown time and time again that he is not interested in correcting it. Instead, he is desperate for the establishment's support to return him to power, where he will inevitably make the same mistakes as before, such as installing incompetent puppets like Usman Buzdar and Pervaiz Elahi.

Despite his flaws, many still support Imran Khan for his perceived stance against those who have betrayed the democratic process by removing him from power. However, the sad truth is that without the establishment's backing, the upcoming elections will not be free or fair. It's time for us to open our eyes and demand true democracy, where the people, not the establishment or corrupt politicians, have the power to elect their leaders.

They are so scared of Imran Khan

English translation, "If Imran Khan comes into power again, he'll bury his political opponents alive. If IK wants to form a Govt, he must ensure us that he won't do anything to PDM when he comes into power."

It's as Rana said. It's either him or us. They're scared of the justice that might prevail.

you morons attacked his house while he wasnt there, you filed 150 bogus FIRs, you tried to kill the guy, forced him to meet up in person to various courts and now you expect him to show leniency. Noice

So question? Could imran khan just agree to it and then find a way to just say ‘ah see the thing is, nope you’re all going to be imprisoned for your crimes’, or would this be illegal to do so?

The Urdu is so bad. Doesn’t look like a reliable publication or probably just a fake quote as there’s no logo.

Can anybody explain to me what is going on in Pakistan?

I am Pakistani but not really in touch with Pakistan due to circumstances, but can anybody explain the situation in Pakistan, I have heard people commenting on the situation in Pakistan for months, but now with the arrest of Imran Khan? Was he even arrrested?

Cool it with the personal attacks. Grow up kids

It's a REALLLY long story that starts in Apr 2022 but I'll try to summarize it.

1. Imran Khan gets ousted as PM in Apr 2022 in a no-confidence vote (Opposition parties bribed IK's candidates to vote against him with the help of the then army chief).
2. IK's decides to go in public and asks for early elections, he does massive jalsas in almost every big city of Pakistan.
3. He announces his first long march in May 2022 but state unleashes unprecedented brutality on his supporters on 25th May.
4. Due to the constant attacks of state force against PTI (IK's party) IK decides to call off the long march.
5. In Nov 2022 IK does another long march, this time there is an assassination attempt on him, which he thankfully survives.
6. IK names State minister of interior, An Army officer and the current PM Shehbaz Sharif for the murder attempt but still he isn't able to get an FIR registered against them despite his Govt being in Punjab.
7. IK decides to dissolve the KP and Punjab assemblies to force a general elections, firstly the army threatens IK's candidates to jump ship but IK is finally able to dissolve those assemblies.
8. After that the Election commission colludes with the Army and the current Govt to not  conduct an election within 90 days (Although Constitution of Pakistan strictly says  that elections ***MUST BE CONDUCTED WITHIN 90 DAYS AFTER ASSEMBLIES ARE DISSOLVED.***
9. IK's party go to the supreme court and get the decision in their favour, SC instructs ECP to conduct elections in 90 days.
10. Now ECP, Army and Govt hands are tied, they don't want an elections because according to all surveys Khan is gonna sweep the elections due to his unmatched popularity.
11. The Govt and Army decide to strangle IK in fake cases of blasphemy, murder and terrorism (As of now he is named in 84 different FIRs).
12. IK is currently living in Zaman Park, Lahore recovering from his assassination attempt injuries.
13. The Govt tries to arrest IK in one of the fake cases but his supporters are adamant that IK must not surrender himself due to Pakistani state's brutal history of murdering popular leaders (Zulfiqar Ali bhutto etc.)
14. The police and Rangers siege IK's house to  arrest him but his supporters put up a fight against Police baton charge, rubber bullets, and tear gas for more than 24 hours.
15. IK's legal team gets a stay from Lahore High Court to stop the Police operation at his house till 10AM 16 March 2023.
16. So far his supporters have been able to successfully repel police forces from arresting him.
17. IK has promised to appear in Court (which previously he didn't because of the security threats to his life).

This is a very brief summary of the developments that have happened in the past 1 year, and I may have missed some events but this is kinda the gist.

The Pakistan Army is currently very unpopular in the masses due to their support of the current Govt which mostly comprises of corrupt and compromised politicians.

Johnny Sins of Pakistan (COAS) tried to be the judge, jury, army, prime Minister, president, politician, democratic, teacher, pizza delivery guy, rocket man, space explorer, shaheen,  babar , father, mother, son, daughter, binary, lawyer, electrician, hafiz, Hitler..

Bhai is time ku tnsn lay rha hai, soja

Hey that’s great you want to learn about Pakistan ! 

So here’s the deal. You probably know Imran Khan came into power few years back, since Pakistan’s been riddled with corrupt politicians for decades (some say since it’s inception). Well Imran Khan was kicked out on a no confidence vote over a year ago, which people find very questionable, and since then IK has been asking for re-elections.

About a week ago they decided to hold elections again, and right after that they release the Toshakhana records (a Governement holding place where every politician and government official must deposit all gifts given to them by foreign politician/diplomats, and if they want that gift they have to pay 20% of the cost of the gift to take it). Imran Khan has been taking about the other parties using Toshakhana very publicly to enrich themselves. He even wanted to raise the limit to purchase gifts to 50%, but still paid 20% himself. The records released showed that Imran Khan did similar purchases from Toshakhana. The arrest warrant was ‘related’ to it but I don’t know the full depth of that. Also the government just ended the whole Toshakhana program. 

People don’t like that IK is being arrested. Hence the protests and riots. My opinion? IK is a better option than what the Sharifs or Zardari/Bhuttos, but he ain’t the best option. We need better leaders. To answer your arrest question, the courts dropped the arrest order, the charges I believe still remain?

Way I look at it, Pakistan political landscape is pretty cutthroat, those that make it to the top are the best at navigating that cutthroat cesspool. Our political filter breeds messed up leaders. We need a better system. Maybe ask Chat GPT-4 for one?

Nothing, pakistan been like this since forever, this is not new

Apparently anyone with Pakistani nationality is getting a billion $ from Saudi. The deadline to notify them was a minute before you posted this :(

It's important to stay in loop man, maybe next time you will get your billion

Hypocrisy. Treachery. Double standards. Loot maar. Apne log apno ko hee loot rahay.

PDM = ?

Not a single PM has ever managed to complete their term so it's just the same old shit of political instability and the military interfering in matters which they shouldn't.

No 😅

Ask a family member

Basically an ex PM of Pakistan refuses to go to court because he is now an ex PM,  uses his followers as shields to avoid a lawful arrest. 

Calls for following the rule of law but that does not apply to him, only others .

Allah isko hidayat dey. Ameen . Pakistan Paindabad.

These posts are supper annoying.

Go to google, search it, read a paper takes 2 minutes. Open twitter scroll for 2 minutes.  That all it takes. 4 minutes and you know what is happening.

Mods whats with these posts? Arent there any rules against these? A question that can be answered by a simple Google search deserves a post?

The Islamabad High Court has ordered that Imran Khan cannot be arrested in any case (new or old) until May 15th.



Imran khan First media talk on camera after arrest



"The CIA's deposing of Imran Khan as Prime Minister, for his opposition to the US drone campaign operating within and from Pakistan, is probably the most under-reported story of the last couple of years." Craig Murray



About him

&gt;Craig John Murray is a Scottish author, human rights campaigner,journalist, and former diplomat for the UK Foreign and CommonwealthOffice.  
&gt;  
&gt;Between 2002 and 2004, he was the British ambassador to Uzbekistan during which time he exposed the violations of human rights in Uzbekistan by the Karimov administration.

for PDMers.

Also for now 76 FIRs have been registered against IK.  source [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dftUsccm67c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dftUsccm67c)

So why did ISI not protect us. This is what CIA does and has been doing since World War 2. Is this such a suprise if it even happened

This is a joke.
Nobody needed the CIA there, the real government of Pakistan always was run from Washington.
Even General Hamid Gul couldn't become Army Chief because it was not approved by Washington.
This incident is on live television.
In the end, deposing of Imran Khan has started the beginning of the end for Pakistan.

I don't know why people find this hard to believe. The US and the CIA literally overthrew an elected government, in Honduras if I remember correctly, because the government wanted to carry out land reforms to help grow things other than bananas so that it could feed its starving populace. And the US was like "Nope, this government has gone too far". 
IK is constantly a thorn in their side; shitting on them for their failed Afghanistan policy with an i-told-you-so in every interview, refusing to set-up or maintain military bases. Yet people are like why would the US fund a coup against him.

Drone attacks were carried out against TTP at the request of our own military. They had already wrapped up by the end of Obama presidency.

Under-reported as well as utter Bullshit.

 Absolutely Not!

Even Imran Khan has admitted that USA didn't intervene to get him removed it was done by Bajwa. But hats off to this group of PTI supporters who are so delusional that they won't even accept what their own leader is saying! Your consistency should be applauded. 

Note: I say group of PTI supporters because I do believe majority of PTI supporters aren't this delusional.

Man PTI propaganda machinery is strong. They even managed to bamboozle a UK ambassador.

Non-bailable warrants issued against Imran Khan in Tosha-Khana case.



Looool Rana bandar holds a press conference and claims he will arrest IK because hes not respecting judiciary. While the spilt brat can say What ever she wants.
If being stupid decisions was an Olympic sport, PDM would get gold medals every damn time 😂

Yay. Even more drama. This country has no hope left.

This tosha-khana BS has to be the most stupidest thing ever.

Funny how the want IK to show up in person, have shit security which results in people entering the judicial complex and now they want to arrest IK for apparently “attacking the court”. Wtf is going on, this Rana bandar is sniffing some real shit

I can’t believe a simple tosha khana case can be made into a case that could end in arresting someone. BS! Establishment and PMLN need to be held responsible for this mess.

PLMN wants to become martyrs before elections. They are trying to create Chaos and force Hafiz saab to move from the back seat to the front seat.

PDM leadership defending this decision right now on TV. Lmao.

It's hard to come up with the stupidest decision of PDM and the Jahil Jurnails. 

A terrorism case was filed against IK for a protest he wasn't even a part of. 

I think the STUPIDEST decision was to continuing on with the PDM experiment by the Jurnails.

Wasn’t he appearing in the court today. 

Plus it isn’t even a criminal offence because he hasn’t done any money laundering like PDM. 

Judges are taking instructions from Mr X and Hafiz saab.

Looks like all the "we are Apolitical" redditors have come here to show how Apolitical they are.

Hafiz is part of the problem, ex-Army personnel being charged with treason, wtf is wrong...he's taking notes from USA....to bankrupt Pakistan so that we will give up our nuclear assets

Political revenge. Am I surprised?

Guess Khan SB's joining Jail Bharo after all.  Bahahahahaha

^(Yeah, it's worth the downvotes)

Here's to hoping he ends up rotting in jail for the rest of his life; that too without coco.

So finally

IK will lead JBT himself by surrendering against judiciary

It will turn IKs destiny into new life

Like ZAB

Police taking Bags inside Imran Khan's house in Zaman Park (Top), Police recovering bags from his house (Bottom).



It was their whole plan. Plant something in his house and later recover it in front of their favorite journalists.

Yup, planted evidence which will be used to justify those bogus terrorism FIRs.

what is disappointing is that some unwated results of cuckold will still defend PDM and Bois after everything

Looting his house like Fortnite

I have been saying this for days and this is exactly what happened. Zero points for originality. 

If a retard like me(I literally have higher functioning autism) can see it coming from a country mile away.....then.....I mean they either did not even try or they are just stupid like that(and even more stupid then me who admittedly has autism).....*mere paas literally koi ilfaaz nahi.*

These dumbasses couldn't even plant evidence right

Paid judiciary asked for planted evidence of wrongdoing. Yeh Jo dehshat gardi hai iske peeche wardi hai

Now that Imran Khan is released, will schools open with immediate effect? And will the destruction stop?

?

no because hes heading to Islamabad High court tomorrow, the chief justice there is biased as hell and pro PDM, just look at how he dissolved a bench after the verdict came in favour of Imran Khan

Well fbise ssc 1 and ssc 2 delayed till 15th may and id think so they will open schools tomorrow for one day... cant say the same for uni... and I think we will get more clarity on this matter on weekend...



Destruction by protestors will stop 

Destruction by PDM and army will not stop


If people don't realize the real issues soon, Pakistan is going to be in a bad spot.

Chairman PTI Imran Khan's Exclusive Conversation on Al Jazeera English



Why no general outrage for attemps on Imran Khan's life?

Three failed attempts, injury, and continued government's attempts to get him in vulnerable situations.  Why there is no general outrage?

they have made life of ordinary citizen so hard that they cant think beyond basics ...

You have people who support the PPP and PMLN, despite knowing full well Zardari and Nawaz have an obscene amount of wealth and property across the world

Majority of Pakistanis are cowards, ignorant and dumb. It's a harsh reality, but reality.

Edit: (Majority through no fault of their own... especially those who lived in abject poverty for generations).

We all saw how Imran Khan was maligned and sabotaged when he tried changing things through "DeMocRacY". Until Zardari, Sharif's, Corrupt Journalists, Judges and Generals are chased and thrown into the sea...
Nothing will change. 

Sri Lanka eventually did it... Can Pakistan?

The purpose for the assassination attempt was create anarchy and completely derail democracy based on this "outrage". They are looking for you and me to give them a reason to use some section/subsection/clause of the Constitution to declare totalitarian control over us. They are trying very hard for this. 

Citizens need to keep clam till elections happen, make sure they contribute to bringing out as many voters as possible. These people are horrified of elections, they know an electoral loss is their true political death. I have been saying this for 2 years on this sub and in my circles, even before the regime change, that the next General Elections will be the most decisive in Pakistan's history.

Pretty much everyone I know was outraged.

because people have inflation to worry about?

Because the public knows by now that we are at the mercy of these crooks and thugs. Regardless of what the public opinion is, regardless of how many people hit the streets, the current political regime backed by "The Boys" is going to assasinate any man that dares to stand up for justice.

Imran Khan tends to exaggerate as well, the powers that be a pretty good at assassinations when they want to be you know. Or at least they used to be.

Second as for the outrage. I have neither the time nor the energy to worry about Imran Khan, cultus is 40x my salary and I still have to work in the morning. Waisay hi mood kharab hai, or kyun chodon

Beghairat hai awaam. Thats why🤷‍♂️

I'll say this though. Dont know about Punjab and Sindh where feudal system makes people into cowards, but God forbid something happens you will very quickly see KP erupt in a shooting contest. 90% of young men there are armed, trained, and are die hard IK supporters

The fallout there will make BLA look like a cupcake party

80% of this subreddit wants to see IK dead because he is actually focused on helping Pakistan improve rather than complain daily about things from the DHA bungalows and do nothing about it.

because IK story changes all the time  

first it was the US that overthrew his government then it was the PDM only then it was the army and the PDM then it was the army only and now its the PDM and the army are the good goods.  

people are beyond caring now as IK history of U turns are biting him in the ass and his recent sucking up to the army shows he has no faith in winning elections without there help. he could lead the movement to bring real demoracy to pakistan  but he wont because the same PTI and the PDM are literally the same party. they have family members in both parties vouching for the same thing lol

If they can kill dudes in Kenya, they can surely kill dudes in Pakistan ..  oh wait.......

Why should I? Woh kya lagta hai mera?

jukna culture of indic language speakers....

I didn’t know it happened, but no reason to outrage. He entered Pakistani politics and knew what kind of game there played. 

I wished the politicians were more pure…

Its a wonder why it did not happen . The chances for a riots in a country of 220 mio people should be rather high. 

Really, it does not take much to change the game: we need 10 baghat singh style attacks in which 3-4 high placed thugs are being killed. Then the crowd should be moving towards the biggest institutions in the main cities. Start attacking to get inside. 

And believe me, they will run like never before. You can give the key then to IK, and let’s go

Is Imran Khan a Revolutionary? A Left Perspective



revolutionary - adjective
  
1. involving or causing a complete or dramatic change.

BY DEFINITION, IK has wholeheartedly changed the perspective of general public, educating them and making them realize on morally corrupt and screwed this count is becoming... hence the call for 'azaadi'. 

If that isn't revolutionary (i.e. dramatic change) then i don't know what is.

Imran Khan is not a revolutionary. He is successful in all aspects of his life so far. Cricket, Philanthropy, Fame, Prosperity etc. Now he just wants to be PM. He wants the real power to do good for the people and have a legacy. 

One and half year ago, if that power came with Bajwa’s blessing, then IK would have gladly given Bajwa an extension. Because it is a win-win situation and IK can do what he wants in public policy and development. If Asim Munir helps him in getting that power, I’m sure all problems will be solved right away.

So IK is not a revolutionary. He doesn’t want any radical change in the power structure as long as he has some power.

Not a revolutionary at all.

Islamabad police promise ‘world-class’ security for NZ team during Pakistan tour



What about its own fucking citizens?

World-class security with pictures of skinny malnourished cops wearing riot gear. Nice.

Their capabilities were seen on; 

May 25, 2022.

October 28, 2022.

And March 15-??, 2023.

While on ARY, it is claimed that ISB police has refused to provide security due to lack of resources

Why so assurities. Isn't like this is what they get paid for. AHs

The gormint says in Supreme court security is bad and elections are delayed. Did no one tells Islamabad police?

What about this “world class security” for Imran Khan!?

Our police + World class security = Naakay everywhere.

Just one advice for NZ….run and don’t look back……this is Pak/ISB Police…..they only serve to criminals…..

Hoping the NZ team boycotts it given the terrible huamn rights and abuse record by the Pakistani Police and government.

World class security Apne logon ke Liye tou Nahin hai. Bahir ke logon ke Liye Kya Hogi.

Unless........ We care more for them than for us. Wouldn't surprise me.

Pakistan considering banning Imran Khan’s party: Defence minister

Imran Khan has given his undertaking that he will appear for court hearing on March 18. CCPO has refused to take the undertaking, further highlighting the malicious intent behind the operation. Khan shares that the operation is part of the London Plan, aimed at getting rid of him by any means.



They aren't going to let him live if he's arrested. He will mysteriously have a heart attack or go through BB events. The man can not be arrested.

Good if there is a legal way out of this and illogical use force can be avoided then so be it.

But I doubt that will end soon, cuz that's not what they want.

If this doesn't end this then I hope those that said bUt hE sHoUlD bE bOlD aNd cOmply wItH tHe lAW can ....... and need to wake the f.up

The flags are so shiny

Why he can’t be arrested? Is he above the rules?

Maryam Nawaz aims to unmask Imran Khan's 'handlers' next week



The fact that her and Bilawal have any relevance whatsoever sums up how backward Pakistan and Pakistanis are.

Embarassing.

She should just go and die already.

The day people stary taking this clown seriously would be the day Pakistan goes under

Foreign funding - fail
Toshakhana - fail
Jewish lobby - fail
Gogi - fail
Faiz and Saqib - fail
Buzdar - fail
Malik Riaz - fail

Up next ladies and gentlemen we have 'handlers', which would be another unique addition to the long list of failures by our ruling party

If she was in US she would have been cancelled a long ass time ago.

She is dumber than her father, it‘s not an easy task.

She should first learn to pronounce "genre".

What else she wants to “unmask”??

It's so clear this woman had a thing for imran.

Darling this ain’t a bolly movie

# Just imagine, Safdar loses patience and unmasks her 20-ton plastic mask......... in public!

There is absolutely nothing they can do to unmask IK. IK's narrative is working because he is sincere in trying to progress Pakistan and is telling us his vision in every jalsa. All PDM have been doing is trying to take down IK and his supporters using fascist tactics. 

Where are PDM's plans for the country? They have done nothing for the last 10 months to indicate that they are trying to fix the issues.

Ffs it's Ramadan plz don't release any por*.

The fact that she is not is jail on itself explains Pakistan’s situation

She is trying to steal IK anti establishment narrative. Too bad no one gives a fuck about her.

I don't think Pakistan has ever been this united and woke in my lifetime and it's a good sight to see.

A lot of people are depressed about the state of affairs in Pakistan and it shows glaringly in the subreddit. But I want to present an optimistic point of view.

What we are now seeing is unprecedented in the history of Pakistan. For the first time, we know the reality of every institution in the country. The average soldier knows that the polo grounds, DHAs, and golf courses are excessive. The civilians on Punjab and Sindh are reassessing what may have happened during the media blackout of FATA and Balochistan between 2006-2014. People know that the bureaucracy doesn't work for them, and they know who pulls their strings and why they pull them. The reality has never been this crystal clear ever.

For the first time, unarmed civilians not belonging to an extremist group repelled an unprecedent and illegal assault by the police and military on a populist leader. We saw socialists and democrats from other parties broke party lines and came out in support.

Sooner or later, civilian supremacy will rule and budgets and funding of all government institution will be brought to question. The momentum has shifted in favor of civilians even though PTI's party chief has tried his very best to retreat and negotiate. Remember that he has expressed interest in surrendering but the people are not letting him. This is because this momentum shift is bigger than Imran Khan. People are fed up of being dictated by scions of colonial stooges.

If things don't get fixed now, the next leader would not be as kind to suppression. To give a comparison, before Mao Zedong, there was San Yat-Sen, who was a moderate. When woke people don't get the freedoms and justice they deserve, the natural course leads to stronger revolutionary leaders. So this is not a one man struggle. Pakistan will progress. It is blessed with the best land in the world. It is blessed with a humble and kind people. It is not a house of cards that can be torn down that easily.

Give me liberty, or give me death!" Patrick Henry. You have to remove the boots of your neck and take your freedom or remain slave to the system that creates beghrait billonare Bajwaa’s.

I agree. I never imagined people would be trolling under ISPR account. I'll take that win.

It’s because Pak people don’t want Mafia Sharif crooked arsehole brothers anymore.

People of pakistan are too uneducated to know what is happening to them. 90% of the common people do not know what custodial torture is or what IMF is. Its like pakistan is a blind person being robbed.

Pakistan is at a very crucial moment right now. What happens in the next few months will make or break the country.

Imran khan ko pakrne ai thei wardi waale karkun ulta koot maar kha ke wapas ghar gai ab hisaab lga rhe hain ke kitna sarkari nuksaan hua aur kitni kut khai. Aur rana sahib? Bas? Ho gaya? Kiya ho gaia bhai? Hum toh samaj rhe the tum aik ghante mein girftar kar lo ge khan ko ulta yahan do din lge tumhein aur toh doh din mein koi girftaari nhn hui haan sirf sarkaari maal ka nuksaan hua hai bilkul.

And how old are you? 12? PML(N) cried hard that army brought PTI after 2018.

Woke yes that it is.

I still think Pakistan is not united. It's at a critical junction

Fake News

Another PDM idiot trying to spread out of context news.

Is Democracy even good for Pakistan?

Democracy just like any other system is a tool to bring about change in a society, organization or a country. A tool that simply gives "power to the people". Unfortunately, the history of Pakistan has been such, that this tool hasn't brought in any good change. Infact, things have nosedived since inception of Pakistan.

The current climate in the country regarding politics is very tense and somewhat grim. I'm assuming that the majority of Pakistan didn't wanted PDM government last year, but since the system of our democracy is designed in such a way here, where people's representatives (ministers) inside the Parliament and Senate, vote for the ultimate change. They aligned with the opposition party last time on their own basis of rationality, keeping the country's interest above all or their own self interest (persuaded by money) - but that's not the topic of discussion right now.

If we tack back over a decade ago, according to the data Pakistan's voting turn over was 44% in 2008. Then 50% or little over that in 2013 and 2018 elections. Rigging variable aside. Almost half if not more of Pakistanis never even bothered to vote in any elections. This could mean one of two things. Those people didn't and still don't trust in the very system of Democracy, or that they don't trust the current setup and the system running behind democracy. They simply don't believe that voting will help bring the change and that this democracy is a puppet tool for the elite behind.

It's undisputed right now that Imran Khan is the most popular leader of a political party among any other party. Even back in 2018, Imran and his party got the most votes and subsequently established the government. Quite a lot many people actually believed that he will bring the change and that their votes will matter. But since his omission from the government office, a number of the voters lost trust in the system (either democracy or setup of people running democracy). Some of the people still may believe that democracy is the solution to bring change, even in current setup. A few others have simply made up their mind that Imran's government couldn't deliver the change that we expected. (I'm using Imran's name here because not everyone had voted solely because of PTI but everyone that had ,voted because of Imran at least).

There's also a slight variable to consider here, that not even one single elected government in Pakistan's history has completed its term, and that's a big red flag for the system of Democracy. Assuming people vote for a party so that they could establish their government for that extended period of time (5 years) and successfully deliver the change that people expect. So it is not fair to judge any government in Pakistan's history on the deliverance of that (promised) change stretching across 5 years, within their cut short period of governance. This instability adds to the lack of trust from parties on the setup, their expectancy to deliver results (may get an excuse - debatable) and the people to put their faith in it. This is a big problem.

What's next then? What's the solution?

Are we expecting that the next democratic election will help bring in the majority people's chosen government and bring in the change that we expect? If lets say it is Imran Khan. How can we be sure that his next government's tenure will not be cut short? How will he bring the change in the next tenure or multiple tenures. Is Two - Third Majority enough to bring the change (is this the contingent?) If not Two - Third majority what will prevent the government not to get ousted again? Is simply amending the constitution and law, enough to start that change? The half majority of people who do not vote because of democracy or the setup. Will they get involved in then?

Lastly, I want to ask you all a question here. 

Do you still trust Democracy and/or this current setup? 
If not, are you looking for an alternative solution besides Democracy?

I'm not giving my opinion or answering right now, because I don't want to influence what you think of that question.

Anatol Lieven argues in his book "Pakistan: A Hard Country" that Pakistan is too democratic in a non-traditional sense, meaning that while Pakistan has a democratic government, its state institutions are weak and society is stronger.

Lieven contends that this situation is the result of a number of historical and social factors, such as the legacy of British colonialism, the enduring power of feudal and tribal elites, and the dominance of the military in Pakistani politics.

He suggests that these factors have contributed to a situation in which the state has struggled to maintain its authority and provide basic services to its citizens, while civil society groups have gained greater influence and power.

People as collective kinship groups are more powerful than state.

And when in power these groups extract patronage and spread it in their group.

Pakistanis are anarchically too democratic

Democracy Housing Association is only thing good for Pakistan.

Democracy has never been given a chance in 75 years. Untill it gets uninterrupted military interference free 20-25 years we cant judge. And yes it will be good for us just look at next door India.

Given that pak army has been raping Pakistan's resources, economy, leadership and is rotten with corruption, pakistan never had democracy to begin with.

Imran Khan is finally starting to realize it, Pak army is it's biggest enemy and we need an inqilab to get rid of them or reduce their power.

&amp;#x200B;

That would be the first step.

Democracy is the "Rule of jungle" just like the chinese have been saying. 

the principle of democracy is whatever the majority wants. now if you have majority literate and loyal people then its gonna work awesome. but if you have illiterate and corrupt people then u are giovng them power through democracy.

Short answer : Yesn't

Long answer: Yes and No. Whatever you pick, people are getting shafted because power and control will be concentrated within the hands of few individuals or families. 

Fix: Nuke the entire system. Eliminate the boomer shits who control everything and bring young people who do not come from rich a-hole backgrounds.

&gt;“democracy is the worst form of government – except for all the others that have been tried."-Winston Churchill

What is the alternative my friend?

Centralized authoritianism wouldn't work in this country. The best you will get is a Military run government or a civilian populist in charge briefly. The Nation is simply too diverse.

Democracy is an excellent moderating tool, especially parliamentary. Yes its often slow and inefficient, but it prevents radicalism in society as people are forced to compromise and build coalitions etc.  


Any technocracy runs the risk of not being legitimate and arguments for it often reek of belief of inherent superiority or that leaders primary responsibility is technical rather than managing differing interests in a country and ensuring a cohesive polity

Democracy is the real hoax

The current setup isn't democracy - it may be klepotcracy it may be plutocracy but one thing it isn't is democracy \*unless\* you take an incredibly narrow definition of democracy as being just the ability to vote.A vote is just a thappa if the vote is controlled e.g. by a "malik", or the voter is systematically kept illiterate, or the voter's choices are forcibly limited (throw weaker politicians in jail, kill them etc.). Unfortunately, all these have consistently been the norm in Pakistan and because the ones in control consistently gain by having this corrupt system they claim is "democracy", they keep on maintaining it and faking people into believing that "democracy has failed"  and thus the only other viable choices are even more authoritarianism where they and they alone can save Pakistan.

its worth noting that almost all the super developed east asian economies that are democracies today (SK Singapore TW) were all under some type of autocratic rule before they democratized...says something about asian values

The Pakistanis in Pakistan never had a say as to whom should be their leaders, When Pakistan became a newly born state there wasn't much the public knew about the internal affairs of their own country since the newsrooms only reported what they were being told to report and it was then the army established itself as the unquestionable rulers. The propaganda of songs and shit were continuously fed to the public to portray them as the good guys and now when their real faces have been revealed they are so deep rooted like a cancer in this country that there is literally no hope except a "surgical operation". Pun most definitely intended lol.

Who wouldn't want a dictator like Nawaz, Zia or Bhutto?

Educracy is the only way bro. I just made that word up but as long as we don't educate ourselves about rights of others and our rights we will never have clearly defined purpose. At the moment, we even lack knowledge about basic humanity.

Good Taliban, Bad Taliban debate must end. All fanatic jihadi mullahs are bad.

Pushing Taliban back to Afghanistan was the greatest achievement by Pakistan army in recent years but somehow we brought them back. Whoever was behind the policy to bring them back with peace treaties is responsible for deaths of Pakistanis.

Jihadi mullahs like Fazlu, and others from LEJ, SipaSahaba, LET, Laal masjid mullah and many others are cancer to our society and the state and establishment must stop supporting them all. 
The way DG ISI Faiz Hamid visited Kabul recently was such a disgrace.

Politicians having a soft corner for fanatic must stop. JI leadership, PMLN leadership, and Imran Khan were leading voices in support of TTP prior to Op Zarb e Azab. That soft corner nonsense has to stop. Khan's govt (with approval of army obviously) even release hundreds of TTP terrorists on request of Afghan Taliban just got good will. Devastating.

This has to end. The nation must not let politicians, army generals and mullahs to bring back terrorism.

Bring back and enforce National action plan and start from taking over madaras with better education or something. 
Bring back army courts to hang hard core terrorists.

We are not animals that gets slaughtered for some stupid policies. It must stop NOW.

I remember when Peshawar happened and it really felt like our 9/11. Public opinion shifted dramatically and even politicians who were soft on the Taliban were suddenly flipping to supporting action against them. It really felt like we had turned a corner and there would be no going back… Alas our political and military leadership have short memories and little dignity.

&gt; PMLN leadership, and Imran Khan were leading voices in support of TTP prior to Op Zarb e Azab

Pml-n are shameless people and always try to judge the direction of wind blowing before speaking. However i think they have tried to distance themselves from extremist rhetoric in recent times. 

On the other hand I'm worried Imran actually believes in the taliban. He has given time and again given pro taliban statements in recent times , like obl shaheed, slavery shackles broken, taliban are regular citizens etc.

So even though I dont trust noonies on this matter but i think they dont believe in that stuff and even if u have heard pro taliban rhetoric from them, u can be sure that its just drama. where as Imran unfortunately actually wants to be buddy with talib .

&gt;start from taking over madaras with better education or something.

I second this suggestion. There should be licencing for religious clerics too. Only licenced/approved moulvis should be allowed to preach in Mosques and madrassas.

Taliban ke hami sab ke sab harami

Never gonna happen, you are speaking to and about people who consider these trashes brothers.

Shehbaz Sharif said he has same aim as Taliban and Taliban Khan thinks we can resolve the issue on table and also allowed dozens of terrorists to walk free. May Allah have mercy on our nation.

JI's leadership doesn't shy way from their open support for TTP. They are basically the less violet deobandis.

Don't Need No Good Taliban, No Bad Taliban, No In-Between Taliban... Need Only Dead Taliban.

I’m all in favour of having stringent regulations on what madrasahs can teach and their curriculum JUST as all school boards are regulated in what they are allowed to teach.

It’s about time to kill the extremist ideologies at their root, namely the madrasahs that preach secretarianism and their graduate mullahs who then go on to incite their clergy to violence, all so that they are able to stay relevant themselves and so that their chanda bucks keep on flowing.

Also, let’s start holding state sponsored national level debates and dialogues on all major religious issues between different firqas. Such a dialogue should of course be heavily moderated to ensure civility. Let the mullahs from each faction put their arguments with rationale from the Quran and sunnah, in front of the public and then let the public decide which ones are right.

Of course, this shouldn’t be a problem for the mullahs if they truly consider themselves honest and pious servants of god. It would be a problem if they were invested in this to further their own means and to fill up their own pockets. 

Surely that’s not the case (/s).

Anyone that loves the Taliban especially the TTP forgot or somehow justifies this evil shit!



https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Peshawar_school_massacre

how did a country founded by a whiskey swiggling pork eating ismaili, who mawdudi opposed the creation of, become a powerhouse of mullahs?

its truly one of the most bizarre fin political transitions in all of history. i really shows how utterly gullable most of the pakistani public is. stupidity at its height. like going from marx to ubl ...it literally makes no sense.

&amp;#x200B;

the abbasids hardly made it pass balochistan, our ancestors were converted by sufis, yet we are today deobandi and barlevi...it makes no sense.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

the pakhtuns who freed kashmir are drone striked and exorted for dollars by the panjabis whose bozorg went and helped the british and general roberts attak muslims...

All the muslim countries, all the mullah’s there are fully educated and have license, here in Pakistan 80% mullah spread extremism and stupid information about Islam without any hadees and quranic reference. How can we progress!!

Bad is good, good is good.

It's never going to happen. As long as religion is used as a tool or business, fanaticism is never going to go away. We will continue to tolerate as long as we see value in these fanatics.

It won't happen until Pakistan becomes a secular, liberal country.

I need to clarify that I am a really idiotic burger so I have zero context on anything Pakistan or Islam or really a lot of stuff.

Can anyone explain why in Pakistan and in other Muslim nations these people keep killing each other?  Why are Muslims so busy killing each other?

Jews who hate Jews who they consider the wrong Jews will throw urine at those Jews. But they don't kill those Jews.  Catholics who hate Catholics who they consider the wrong Catholics create their own echo chamber.

I understand Muslims have used murder as a weapon for example Adam Curtis (Reddits favorite person) made an AMAZING documentary about what Iran did in the 1970s and 1980s.  He also made some about other Muslim nations that explore why violence is used against other Muslims.

Do we have a reason for it? Or is it just something that happens?

Two things need to happen first:

1. Take land and factories away from the military. Their resources need to be brought under government control. No unofficial money = no independent power = no back channel propping of militants. All decisions should be made by politicians who can be held accountable.

2. Launch a massive public education development policy teaching English, science, and technology in every corner of Pakistan. Use syllabus from successful countries - Scandinavian, South Korean, Singapore, etc. Also, reverse the Arabic language nonsense that Imran Khan pushed into the syllabus and replace it with computer science. It's mind-bogglingly stupid.

They were created by the army to supply a steady stream of people to fight without a uniform. Blame the army

Nothing is fundamentally going to change. Our establishment is stubborn in supporting these lunatics. Even Americans failed to convince our generals.

As long as mudrassas teaching al zihad aren't shutdown this will keep happening.

Taliban getting control of Afghanistan is more of a US failure rather than the amazing work of army

Thank you,Thank you,thank you. Reject all fanaticism ideologies,salafist,Wahhabism propagation under zia has been detrimental to Pakistan

All Mullahs are bad

TTP bad, Afghan T good

There isn't clear information from the past but I don't think Taliban fired the first bullet

What about the institution that creates these groups, supports them and then start this discussion of good taliban bad taliban?

Good naan bread, bad naan bread debate must end. All fanatic jihadi breads are bad!!

There was never a good or bad Taliban debate.
It was afghan and non afghan Taliban debate.
Since Pakistan has nothing to do with them

Jihad is a very broad and precarious word in islam
Lets not associate this word with these scumbags

Good politicians, bad politicians, good Generals, bad Generals.

I understand that Imran Khan is the last and only hope for Pakistan, some of their supporters have this cultist persona where they don’t even want to listen to anyone else.

Man really thought we were gonna agree.

What’s wrong with this video?
They wanna plead their case in Allah’s court? What’s wrong with that?
Call me low iq but I don’t know what’s wrong with this video.

with the title i thought video would be like "corruption bhi karay tu imran acha hai", but i think OP attached the wrong video

making dua for imran khan = cultist

bhutto abhi zinda hai (bc 100 saal pele margya tha)= not cultist at all

English tu dur ki bat OP ko Urdu b ni ati

Stop crying about IK and go clean some trash from your gali

So having Islamic beliefs is considered cultist persona ?

# Looks like 'cult' is the newest word in some c*nt's vernacular after they exhausted all others! Pathetic.

Y’all are out of touch with ordinary Pakistani people and it’s pretty easy to tell. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with making dua to Allah for Imran Khan, especially for Allah to guide him and make him righteous. Even the Imam of Masjid Al-Aqsa, Ekrima Sabri, makes dua for IK.

Who this ? New phone.

So praying for your country while highlighting the lack of justice in the country counts as being a cultist now?

The fundamental problem with people is that they think IK can single-handedly change the course of Pakistan, and all during his lifetime.

The man is 70 already and he has left the reins of his party with Raja Dakait.

Just think about that.

This is a stupid take i understand what you are trying to say but every movement/Party is a cult because all of them have some form of radical elements albeit most of the time very small , so does then actions of the few define every man and women?

Not to mention i am not seeing anything wrong with this Video, but i guess i must be a cultist for wanting the better of my country/family by praying for it

Mr scholar.. where is cult in this video? regular people praying for justice and their leader.

These are regular people who are praying for the victory of their political parties and want divine justice. It's tik-tok-like cringe to film that and it's putting your bet on the wrong man that being IK. But it's not a cult. Just regular people.

bilo rani is this you behind this post😂

Point 1 wrong in this video

Op chutyay dekhe hein tere jesa pehli bar dekh raha hon

These types of videos are generally made to garner attention and nothing else.

What's up with the uptake of these posts against IK?

The video is barely related to the title. This is reddit not twitter.

Great. Lets mix more religion into politics than we already have. So we can devalue both at the same time

A lot of people overlook his shortcomings during his 4 years in power. He had some great ideas and policies but that all went out the window in his attempt to form government. He aligned himself with religious fundamentalist, feudal lords and the political establishment- people who he had been a vocal critic of. Also, persecution of minorities escalated under his watch, where their houses were raided, individuals locked up under bogus cases and ironically, that's exactly what's happening to IK and his party now. What goes around, comes around.

This is kinda cringe ngl

If you think standing for ones right is a cult, then bad news for you is that you are in a cult too, where you dont even know what your rights are so you dont even know what to stand for...

Think on your life choices. Be a better person, know your rights and stand by them with Faith in heart. 

Long live Pakistan, long live Imran Khan

Making clown of themselves has gotta be one of weirdest fetishes but here we are.

That's what you do when you think one guy is goona solve everything. Meme material people.

Okay I probably need to explain this post since everyone has started calling me a kafir. 

My point was to show that many of Imran Khans die hard supporters don’t seem to be doing anything physically that directly benefits our economy. Most of them seem to just be saying “O Allah protect our Imran Khan” or “we pray Imran Khan will be back in power to fix everything” etc…

No hate toward Imran, I voted for him back then and will vote for him again. My point is that if we actually got up and did something that will truly contribute to the betterment of Pakistan, then maybe when Imran comes into power everything will be more and more easy for this guy. 

If we don’t do anything and Imran comes into power, he simply won’t be able to do anything. He’s not a magician that will overnight the growth of our economy. 

That’s it. That’s was my point. I didn’t mean to say anything bad but just phrased the title wrong.

HAHHAHAHAHHAHAHA 😄😂😂

Police (pimps) broke into Imran Khan house Zaman Park.

They have turned on full on Badmashi mode because they have lumber 1 on their back. They really want to create an anarchy in Pakistan. 
Fuck this system and whoever responisble for this.

Time to march on GHQ and army house. 5-6k ppl can easily block pindi kacheri underpass area that leads to army house. Another 10k to protest outside the 5-6 ghq entrances, but then again who’s willing to.

Been staring at this post for 20 mins now and idk what to say.

Aik hi cancer ha bhai, sub ko pata ha leken koi baat nhi karta, kese main ghairat nhi inka unlawful rule khatam karni ki

Yeh Jo dehshat gardi hai iske peeche wardi hai.

Sorry, at work. Didn't see any channel .

Time to break into avenfield apartments.

Source?

Whats sad is how the top brass of police is tagging along.
Ig, dig, ssp what are you doing was this what you supposed to be doing? Sad and pathetic and this is because no one talks about this. How come police is being used as a political tool and why it is happening? Cant the courts see this? Fir, compalints.

Both of them are in jail rn for no reason 😢

I think Imran Khan is biggest hurdle in way of Revolution for Pakistan..!



I think if my aunt had wheels, she would be a bicycle!

He fubars every attempt to revolution.

[Not sure what you meant to write there.](https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-vf-au-revc&amp;sxsrf=APwXEdc6tqBjzxDa3U6eJluhXQhxkG8MOA:1682948411855&amp;q=godzilla+had+a+stroke+reading+that+and+died&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjB6I2yn9T-AhVtgf0HHWu6AjwQ0pQJegQIEBAB&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=612&amp;dpr=4#imgrc=Eu6Qirkn1VPvEM)

It obviously is not the fascism of PDM or people who vote for corrupt legacy parties in exchange for biryani

Brhh IK is revolution.

I support pti, but we would need more camera angles to truly find how many people came out. This video is too blurry.

Pakistan needs real democracy

Prime minister should be abolish to implement the type of functional democracy like in the west. The population must vote for choosing by themselves directly.

There wasn't a foreign conspiracy, Imran Khan lied

western democracies also have prime ministers? the only difference is they don't have a lumber 1 general pulling the strings

Was this written by an AI lol

With all due respect lan kha

Imran khan advice to the nation

Out of all the things he's said thus far, this one holds the most weight. 

We **need** to put our faith in the struggle and not the person leading it. The biggest issue plaguing PTI is the lack of leaderhsip after IK. Whoever takes up the mantle needs to believe in **OUR** struggle through and through.

And, with all due respect to SMQ, I do not see him working for the struggle.

What did we do to deserve this guy.

If you don't fight for the  change the disaster will eat you up.

Ramazan mubarak to everyone except Pakistan Army generals, PDM and their supporters. 

I will support anyone including RSS, Indian Army and even Dajjal except these people. May Allah's wrath be on them and their future generations.

Cricket analogy for politics creates polarization and is divisive, instead politics should be visualized for what it actually is, if it helps, instead of cricket picture something like a jirga.

~ Imran Khan ki El aur wicket for gayi
~ Empire ki ungli uth gai



In the realm of political discourse, analogies play a crucial role in shaping public perception. While the cricket analogy for politics may have its merits, its inherent competitive nature can inadvertently fuel polarization and division.

A more inclusive and harmonious vision of politics can be found in the concept of a jirga, a traditional assembly rooted in collective decision-making and consensus-building.

 Visualizing politics through the lens of a jirga emphasizes dialogue, cooperation, and respect for diverse perspectives. By adopting this analogy, we promote a transformative approach to politics that fosters unity, inclusivity, and shared responsibility—essential elements for a thriving democracy.

Our leaders and our hypocrisy

We are fine with army meddling in politics as long as the middle finger is not going our side.. Imran Khan will happily accept a deal the day he is offered.. And u guys will go back to army lumber 1 narrative.. The day you guys accept that the only reason nawaz sharif was ousted was due to army and Imran Khan was in the power coz of army.. Is the day when nature will heal

I am pretty sure it has always been clear as crystal to the majority of people that political power changes in this country were a result of army's meddling

NOT SAYING THAT ITS OK, COZ ITS NOT

they should stick to defense

people knew they brought sharifs (literally Zia did)
people knew they allowed PPP to make governments
people knew they brought PTI to power

everyone knew it

but when the army brought back the looters of the past, thats when the jig was up

and yeah, no one is gonna trust em again

go get out of your house and check for the lowley farmers or workers, even they openly insult the armed forces (which is something I never expected or believed would be possible)

They will never accept it. What we don't realize is that this makes people weaker, when politicians know that they can come into power without the people, why will they try to make our lives better? 

Also IK trying his best to stop the VONC was in the spirit of constitution according to some folks. In my opinion, IK stopping it and PDM not scheduling the elections in 90 days, both are unconstitutional

We are not fine. We were never fine. Stop imposing your acceptance on us and generalizing.  Our fathers and grandfathers always told us about this 'meddling' we were always aware of the reality but it was the 'danda' and the authoritarian style of military and military blessed governments that keeps us middle class, blo*dy civilians from having a say in any of this.

Nope. Even PTI supoorters wont return to loving the army

Is it really that much because of the army that Imran Khan came into power when he has so much political support from the people? 

If the army remained neutral, he would have still won. 

Like even now, when the army is supposedly against him, he still has so much support, even more than before it seems. 

This country calls itself a democracy, so let the people decide their faith.

Funny how new accounts with less then a month old keeps coming to this sub for posting shit about IK like how he is bad and shit. like come on who are you trying to fool?  People arent stupid to fall for your paid shit here.

I've got a few questions

Did Shehbaz Sharif strengthen US ties with Pakistan?  


Why did Imran Khan never have a meeting with President Biden?  


What was Imran Khan's stance on the Russo-Ukraine war?  


is it true that the Pak Military has become substantially stronger since Shehbaz Sharif was in Power?  


Does President Biden even like Shehbaz sharif? and did he really put Shehbaz Sharif in power?  


and has Biden had a meeting with Shehbaz Sharif since he became prime minister?

Yes.

No clue.

No clue.

Yes.

There's a theory.

No clue.

Pakistani People, Listen up! If God forbid something were to happen to Imran Khan, this is the leader that we should be following next.



Ali Muhammad Khan, Asad Umar, Murad Saeed. I want to see one of them as the next Chairman of PTI.

real id se ao murad saeed

Stop making threads like this please, you’ll give poor SMQ a heart attack.

Is that the guy who faked his degree and transcripts?

Great, maybe then we can get our "do sau arab" back?

Yes!

Isn't this the jahil guy who faked his degrees?

hes is on of them: not too seasoned yet. 

Good motivational speaker.. but i believe he lacks strategy to counter evil plans of traitors

Yes.

It's an absolute necessity that immi boy's successor should also be a 2-digit IQ loudmouth delusional dullard whose vapidity surpasses his own judgment 🤡🤡🤡

Lol 😂

Who is this?

Ah 100 arab

ah yes follow this guy blindly cuz I like him, no visible iman showing just another inbred trash to replace an older inbred trash. just run off of this country.

Is the op on drugs? No one would follow this shitbag

Mummy daddy ?

I don't think so this guy has what it takes to be the next IK. IK himself is the last of his kind.

Sahil adeem is a pkistani scholar who is thinking of Politics too, if he ran for prime minister he’d get my vote

I believe it has already been decided that it will be Shah Mehmood, since the vice chairman is next to chairman. I think IK even said in an interview.

Why we thinking about anything happening to IK? We should be focused on stopping anything happening to him!

MQM was forced to rejoin Imran Khan's cabinet, by torture of MQM workers! Faisal Subzwari



Achanak phir hokam mila kay PDM join karlo.

all these politicians are trying to find reasons to lie and win back some public trust lol

MQM "we have no moral authority or backbone and just go where we're told so nothing is our fault guys give us chance plz"

What a load of bs 🤣

They had 2 fu_king ministries for their measly 6 National assembly seats, still they kept throwing hissy fits about how they were being eXpLoiTeD. Koi sharam hoti hai, kuch haya hoti hai.

Gee bilkul jo mqm locals ke sath krti rhi he.. Woh treatment ho rha tha inke apne sath

Bikao hain sale.

Even a beghairat has more ghairat than mqm

Mqm changes thier statement like I change undies.

Faisal Subzwari, member of MQM-P is the current Minister for Maritime Affairs.

&gt;The MQM-P spokesperson claimed that **officials in plainclothes picked up these four workers** during last week and they were not disclosing their whereabouts yet, he added.

President PTI Sindh abducted from Karachi. Democracy is suspended in this country, people must save Pakistan now. #ReleaseImranKhan



Imran Khan says no talks if govt insists on elections in Sept or Oct



IK vs Pakistan Daku movement

12 hours of chaos. The police and army have refused to provide security for elections but a whole battalion of rangers, Islamabad police and Punjab police some how have the time to beat up people at Zaman Park. 

This country is a joke, judiciary sleeping, hafiz sahab doing what ever he pleases and the cabal of Sicilian Mafia is roaming free. Beghairti ki tamaam haddein paar kar ke be ye IK ko nhi pakar sakey 

https://www.dawn.com/news/1742146/zaman-park-stand-off-for-imrans-arrest-continues-for-more-than-12-hours-as-more-reinforcements-arrive

The army can't provide securtiy because they can only provide threaths for Pakistan.

Laanat on every fauji

Not just the top brass, but all the way down to the fauji

They'll be the ones that kill, maim and murder Pakistanis on the streets in broad daylight..

I have never wanted to take a tear gas to the face more cause at this point thats the only thing we can do we tried the revolution through election and found its too gentle for these barbaric cunts the only understand language of DUNDA

All that ispr drama opium is wearing off. I can see scenarios where people will storm ghq. Kitnon ko maarengay kameenay jarnail?

Pak Army motto 

Chori ka taqwa, jihad fi sabilillah Pakistanio per.

Can't fight terrorists in our soil, feel good fighting civilians cause they don't have weapons.

lunber fuaj 1

As a armchair historian every revolution starts when a bullet goes flying into the crowd it happened in Syria and Iran (1979) and countless other times 

Allah rehm kry

Imran Khan giving interview with Tear Gas Shells placed on the table to International Media BBC, Sky News, CNN, Al Jazeera etc.



chad move

IK thug life, imagine NS giving an interview with parchian in his hands, SS with a begging bowl and the spoilt brat with a pineapple lol

Based Leader

At least these one were no expired. The last time police fired expired shells and PTI protested against it.

BAMF

Imran Khan ki Khatir Pakistan ki khatir bahir niklo, if you can please spread this information everywhere on every social media platform. Alteast you can do this?

Waisay in geniuses se koi poochay kay bhala wo koi chooha hai andar ghusa hua jo gas marne se bahar ajayega? Atleast do something right my dear army,  Na apse hukumat sae horai hai, na apse terrorism roka jaraha ha, apki fence b pathano ne bech di utha kay matlab koi aik kaam to theek say kr lo.

One thing I would change, he shouldn't have dressed up for it. Should have popped a window too to breath in some of that tear gas.
